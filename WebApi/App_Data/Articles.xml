    <Summary>All published to GoDaddy I now have a website that talks to a web server where it stores articles in an XML file and uploads images. You have no idea what a huge accomplishment this is for me, if only because I've been meaning to do it for years.</Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>I am happy. I had to work through a lot of issues to finally after all these years, get something published up on my goDaddy platform. There's a lot more I want to do but now that I got a basic system working I can add functionality a lot easier.  All I have to do is press publish.
Next I want to use the same features to write my book(s).  And here I am back on Labor Day Sunday night.</p><p>So, after all these years, where do I want to store my book, in XML. Fine I can then build a way to convert it to a word text document, or whatever format publishers would want it in.</p><p>I just built a thing that has chapters and sections. That should be enough. So now I want a new API Controller. The verb metaphor works just fine doesn't it. </p><p>Now, a few days later, I'm back up an running. There's plenty of changes that need to be made.</p><p>Now I'm trying to extend this article building tool to a book publishing tool. You should see what I just did this afternoon! After all these years I just went ahead and got the Pohnpei book metaphor put together and working. Just now I went in and made a few fixes and it looks great. now all I have to do is figure out to get it to load and page. </p><p>&lt;h2&gt;Design Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;</p><p><br></p><p>I'm thinking of putting all my chapters and sections into xml the way I am saving this article

    <Summary>There's no point talking about impeachment so long as the base of the party conservatives stick with him. Trump is not the problem. All the people who he really truly represents are the problem.</Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[Theological gymnastics. How can conservatives be so blatantly hypocritical?  Nothing said about Trump matters as long conservatives and evangelicals remain dedicated to Trump and all that he represents. So what is it he represents? You hear the term resentment, white resentment. What does this mean? 
  Here's the bottom line: people with strong religious beliefs resent those who don't share their views. Consider the word "resentment". Resentment describes a very powerful feeling. Resentment closely resembles, and easily compares with hate. 
  Nothing on the criminal prosecution front can impact that hate. ]]></Contents>

    <Summary>The White House has secretly amassed a committee of federal agencies from across the government to combat public support for marijuana and cast state legalization measures in a negative light, while attempting to portray the drug as a national threat, according to interviews with agency staff and documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.

But rather than seek objective information, the committee’s records show it is asking officials only to portray marijuana in a negative light, regardless of what the data show.</p><p>“The prevailing marijuana narrative in the U.S. is partial, one-sided, and inaccurate,” says a summary of a July 27 meeting of the White House and nine departments. In a follow-up memo, which provided guidance for responses from federal agencies, White House officials told department officials, “Departments should provide … the most significant data demonstrating negative trends, with a statement describing the implications of such trends.”</p><p>As several states have approved laws allowing adults to use and purchase cannabis, critics have contended lax attitudes will promote drug abuse, particularly among youth, and they have pressed for a federal crackdown.

Its reports are to be used in a briefing for Trump “on marijuana threats.”</p><p class="ql-align-center">“There is an urgent need to message the facts about the negative impacts of marijuana.”</p><p>“Staff believe that if the administration is to turn the tide on increasing marijuana use there is an urgent need to message the facts about the negative impacts of marijuana use, production, and trafficking on national health, safety, and security,” says the meeting summary.</p><p>The White House declined to discuss the committee's process, but indicated it was part of an effort to remain consistent with the president's agenda.</p><p>“The Trump Administration’s policy coordination process is an internal, deliberative process to craft the President’s policies on a number of important issues facing the American people, and ensure consistency with the President’s agenda," Lindsay Walters, Deputy White House Press Secretary, told BuzzFeed News.</p><p>None of the documents indicate that officials are seeking data that show marijuana consumption or legalization laws, which have been approved in eight states, serve any public benefit or do a better job of reducing drug abuse.</p><p>Coordinated by White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the committee met on July 27 with many of the largest agencies in the federal government, including the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and State. An unclassified summary of the meeting, obtained by BuzzFeed News, says the memo is “predecisional and requires a close hold.” And it says the notes were not to be distributed externally.</p><p>The White House followed up the next week by sending agencies and other departments — including the departments of Defense, Education, Transportation and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency — instructions to submit two-page, bulleted fact sheets that identify marijuana threats and issues with the initiatives by Aug. 10.</p><p>While spokespeople at those agencies declined to comment on the committee itself, asked if the Education Department had submitted its response to the White House, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for the agency, told BuzzFeed News this week, “I’m told we did turn it in on time to the WH.”</p><p>A State Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, “The State Department regularly coordinates with ONDCP on a wide range of drug control issues.

The agencies were asked to describe how the drug poses threats to their department and the consequences of marijuana “on national health and security.”</p><p>“We are asking each agency to provide information on marijuana,” White House ONDCP staffer Hayley C. Conklin wrote in an email to department leaders on Aug. 1. She cited the guidance document, saying, “it will assist you in providing the appropriate information.”</p><p>Contacted by BuzzFeed News about the committee, Conklin told BuzzFeed News, “Thank you so much for calling, but I cannot comment,” then hung up the phone.</p><p>A number of agencies also declined to comment — including the departments of Labor, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Transportation.</p><p>None of the 14 agencies BuzzFeed News contacted for this story, the DEA, or the White House denied the marijuana committee’s existence.</p><p>John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, blasted the committee’s slanted approach to the facts and the “alienating effort on behalf of the president. ”</p><p>“This is a terrible political move by the administration,” he told BuzzFeed, saying that the committee’s agenda betrays Trump’s pledges to protect states from federal intervention — a position with overwhelming public support.</p><p>Hudak added it would be “policy malpractice” to only collect one-sided data. “The coordination of propaganda around an issue that the president ostensibly supported is fairly unprecedented.”</p><p>“This is a president who is not serious about states rights and regulatory reform in areas like drug policy, and is not serious about telling the truth to the American people or members of Congress from his own party," Hudak said, pointing to Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, who authored legislation that would protect states rights on marijuana and has praised Trump on the issue.</p><p>Gardner’s office did not reply to requests to comment on the committee.</p><p>Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat who is also running for governor this year, slammed the committee in a statement Wednesday. ”Pres. Trump is flailing on marijuana policy, sometimes saying the states should decide, while also allowing the Attorney General and other prohibition supporters in his purview to run amuck. If the White House is actually spreading misinformation about marijuana to undercut states’ rights, it’s appalling but not out of the ordinary for President Trump and his gang of prohibition supporters,” Polis said.</p><p>Although the White House said last year that it expected “greater enforcement” of marijuana in states where it’s legal, Trump has since suggested he'd support Gardner's legislation to allow states to legalize marijuana untouched by the Justice Department. The move seemed to jab at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has relentlessly threatened a pot crackdown. As leader of the Justice Department, Sessions has&nbsp;<a style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dominicholden/jeff-sessions-goes-full-on-1980s-and-warns-america-to-just" target="_blank">recited 1980s-style rhetoric</a>&nbsp;about saying no to marijuana.</p><p>But Americans have diverged from the federal government’s hardline stance on pot prohibition — with eight states having now legalized its adult recreational use and authorizing systems to sell it like alcohol.

These claims were based on the strong cross-sectional relationship between Trump support and lacking a college education. Using a representative panel from 2012 to 2016, I find that change in financial wellbeing had little impact on candidate preference. Instead, changing preferences were related to changes in the party’s positions on issues related to American global dominance and the rise of a majority–minority America: issues that threaten white Americans’ sense of dominant group status. Results highlight the importance of looking beyond theories emphasizing changes in issue salience to better understand the meaning of election outcomes when public preferences and candidates’ positions are changing.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>This study evaluates evidence pertaining to popular narratives explaining the American public’s support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. First, using unique representative probability samples of the American public, tracking the same individuals from 2012 to 2016, I examine the “left behind” thesis (that is, the theory that those who lost jobs or experienced stagnant wages due to the loss of manufacturing jobs punished the incumbent party for their economic misfortunes). Second, I consider the possibility that status threat felt by the dwindling proportion of traditionally high-status Americans (i.e., whites, Christians, and men) as well as by those who perceive America’s global dominance as threatened combined to increase support for the candidate who emphasized reestablishing status hierarchies of the past. Results do not support an interpretation of the election based on pocketbook economic concerns. Instead, the shorter relative distance of people’s own views from the Republican candidate on trade and China corresponded to greater mass support for Trump in 2016 relative to Mitt Romney in 2012. Candidate preferences in 2016 reflected increasing anxiety among high-status groups rather than complaints about past treatment among low-status groups. Both growing domestic racial diversity and globalization contributed to a sense that white Americans are under siege by these engines of change.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/keyword/elections" target="_blank">elections</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/keyword/mass-opinion" target="_blank">mass opinion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/keyword/political-psychology" target="_blank">political psychology</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/keyword/status-threat" target="_blank">status threat</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/keyword/economic-voting" target="_blank">economic voting</a></li></ul><p>When the people have spoken, it is critical to understand what it is that they have said. Nonetheless, even in high-profile American presidential elections, this important task typically is left to journalists and pundits who are unlikely to have the ideal tools, or adequate data to address this question. Because elections are not amenable to experimentation, it is difficult for scholars to make strong causal claims. As a result, most interpretations of election outcomes either rely on cross-sectional associations in survey data or are inferred from aggregate data on voting patterns by geographic areas. Neither approach is the best that can be done.</p><p>In observational settings, panel data are widely acknowledged as the ideal basis for causal conclusions (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-1" target="_blank">1</a>). When analyzed appropriately, they have the ability to eliminate most potentially spurious associations. Surprisingly, there are few panels available to examine most election outcomes. The major data collections pertaining to elections are cross-sectional in design. However, for the two most recent presidential elections, a large, representative probability sample of the American public was interviewed in both October 2012 and again in October 2016, shortly before Donald J. Trump’s victory. This panel provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the basis of mass support for the winning candidate, support that ultimately elected Donald J. Trump. What changed during this 4-year period to facilitate his support?</p><p>To date, the dominant narrative explaining the outcome of the 2016 presidential election has been that working class voters rose up in opposition to being left behind economically (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-2" target="_blank">2</a>). Those who lost jobs or experienced stagnant wages purportedly punished the incumbent party. These claims were made on the basis of aggregate demographic patterns tied to voters’ education levels, patterns that could occur for a multitude of reasons. This study evaluates the “left behind” thesis as well as dominant group status threat as an alternative narrative explaining Trump’s popular appeal and ultimate election to the presidency. Evidence points overwhelmingly to perceived status threat among high-status groups as the key motivation underlying Trump support. White Americans’ declining numerical dominance in the United States together with the rising status of African Americans and American insecurity about whether the United States is still the dominant global economic superpower combined to prompt a classic defensive reaction among members of dominant groups.</p><p><br></p><h2>Electoral Behavior in 2016</h2><p>Thus far, the limited studies of the 2016 election have been rooted in the popular belief among political scientists that campaigns do not change public opinion so much as “activate” or “prime” certain considerations over others. In other words, by making some issues more salient than others, campaigns increase the extent to which those particular issue opinions are used by voters when choosing a candidate. As a recent study analyzing 2016 preferences framed this question, “Which factors became more strongly or weakly associated with people’s choices in 2016 compared to 2012?” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-3" target="_blank">3</a>). To answer the question, this panel study used individual issue attitudes measured in 2011 to predict presidential preferences in 2012 and 2016. The motivation for using 2011 attitudes is said to be eliminating concerns regarding endogeneity: that is, “the possibility that people changed their attitudes to match their candidate preference” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-3" target="_blank">3</a>); however, methodologists concur that “lag identification is almost never a solution to endogeneity problems in observational data” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-4" target="_blank">4</a>).</p><p>This particular interpretation requires the assumption that voters’ opinions did not change from 2011 to 2016; instead, what changed was the salience attached to various issue opinions. If one assumes unchanged issue opinions since 2011, then the increased salience of race, religion, and immigration attitudes accounts for the shift toward Trump. This interpretation is different from suggesting that people’s opinions on these issues changed over time or that Trump positioned himself closer than other candidates to where the average voter was on these issues. This analysis assumes that voters’ issue positions are largely stable and that the major party candidates occupy roughly the same positions from one election year to the next. The study also suggests that economic stress was more salient in 2016 than in 2012. In another study attempting to explain Trump support, racial and gender attitudes were found to factor more heavily in 2016 voter preferences than in 2012 preferences (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-5" target="_blank">5</a>). This cross-sectional analysis found no evidence that economic dissatisfaction played a role in vote choice.</p><p>Evidence that altered issue salience is responsible for vote change is difficult to distinguish from evidence that change is due to learning the issue positions of candidates and/or from changes in issue opinions (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-6" target="_blank">6</a>). When analyzed appropriately, panel data make it possible to distinguish these processes. If people’s issue opinions are stable over time and these issue opinions predict preferences more strongly in one election year than in another, then evidence points to increased issue salience. However, if issue opinions change over time, or the major party candidates reposition themselves on these issues, then evidence suggesting that increased issue salience is responsible for changes in vote choice is easily confounded with other theoretical explanations for changes in candidate preference. Neither of the two previous studies of the 2016 election have disentangled these possibilities.</p><p><br></p><h3>Pocketbook Voting.</h3><p>The left behind thesis fits most squarely within the rational choice or “pocketbook” theoretical camp, arguing that voters reward the party that has benefitted them financially and punish the party that did not. Thus, easily accessible information about one’s personal financial wellbeing was the assumed basis for a referendum on the party in office. Consistent with this theme, the “rust belt” of the Northeast and the Midwest played an unexpected role in Trump’s victory, contributing to the widespread claim that economic hardship was largely responsible for Trump’s success (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-2" target="_blank">2</a>). Interestingly, this explanation is being popularly embraced by liberals as well as conservatives. As summarized in a recent article in <em>The Atlantic</em>, “Perhaps the clearest takeaway from the November election for many liberals is that Hillary Clinton lost because she ignored the working class” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-7" target="_blank">7</a>). Polling data from throughout the campaign made it clear that less educated whites were indeed Trump’s staunchest supporters, but precisely why this demographic favored him remains unclear.</p><p>There are two reasons for skepticism regarding the assumption that personal economic hardship drove Trump support. First and foremost, over many decades of scholarship, evidence of voters politicizing personal economic hardship has been exceedingly rare (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-8" target="_blank">8</a>). Although aggregate-level evidence has been suggestive of a public that blames incumbents for general economic downturns and rewards incumbents for economic gains, these relationships seldom hold up at the level of individual economic hardship. For example, those who recently lost jobs are unlikely to blame government policy for their personal circumstances (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-9" target="_blank">9</a>), and those who have personally suffered financially under a given administration are no more likely to vote against the incumbent (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-10" target="_blank">10</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-11" target="_blank">11</a>). Across a wide range of issues, scholars have found that citizens seldom form policy or candidate preferences on the basis of their family’s personal economic self-interest. This is not to suggest that citizens never do so, but the conditions under which this occurs are very rare (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-12" target="_blank">12</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-13" target="_blank">13</a>). Even membership in groups with economic interests that have been helped or hurt seldom changes political preferences (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-14" target="_blank">14</a>).</p><p>A second reason for skepticism regarding the left behind thesis involves timing. Trump’s victory took place in the context of an economic recovery. Throughout the year preceding the election, unemployment was falling, and economic indicators were on the upswing. Likewise, the dramatic drop in US manufacturing jobs took place during the first decade of the 21st century; since 2010, manufacturing employment in the United States has actually increased somewhat (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-15" target="_blank">15</a>). Research on economic voting suggests that recent economic events are most influential for voting (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-16" target="_blank">16</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-17" target="_blank">17</a>). Given all of the positive economic indicators, why would 2016 be ripe for an economic backlash? The most common explanation is that it is precisely those who did not recover from the Great Recession of 2008 who elected Trump, those who were left behind by virtue of ongoing joblessness and/or stagnant wages.</p><h3>Perceived Status Threat.</h3><p>One way to understand the surprising public acceptance of openly disrespectful statements about women, minorities, and foreigners is as manifestations of preexisting racist and sexist views; in other words, the 2016 election raised the salience of people’s preexisting views on these topics, so that they mattered more to presidential vote choice in 2016 (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-5" target="_blank">5</a>). However, as with the economic hardship thesis, the timing of Trump’s rise to power is curious. How is it that the same American public that elected an African American to two terms as US President subsequently elected a president known to have publicly made what many consider to be racist and sexist statements?</p><p>A possible explanation is dominant group status threat. When members of a dominant group feel threatened, several well-established reactions help these groups regain a sense of dominance and wellbeing. First, perceived threat makes status quo, hierarchical social and political arrangements more attractive (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-18" target="_blank">18</a>). Thus, conservatism surges along with a nostalgia for the stable hierarchies of the past. Perceived threat also triggers defense of the dominant ingroup, a greater emphasis on the importance of conformity to group norms, and increased outgroup negativity (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-19" target="_blank">19</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-20" target="_blank">20</a>). It is psychologically valuable to see one’s self as part of a dominant group; therefore, when group members feel threatened, this prompts defensive reactions. It is precisely this form of group threat that may have motivated Trump supporters (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-21" target="_blank">21</a>).</p><p>Two forms of group status threat are especially prominent in the United States today. For the first time since Europeans arrived in this country, white Americans are being told that they will soon be a minority race (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-22" target="_blank">22</a>). The declining white share of the national population is unlikely to change white Americans’ status as the most economically well-off racial group, but symbolically, it threatens some whites’ sense of dominance over social and political priorities. Furthermore, when confronted with evidence of racial progress, whites feel threatened and experience lower levels of self-worth relative to a control group. They also perceive greater antiwhite bias as a means of regaining those lost feelings of self-worth (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-23" target="_blank">23</a>).</p><p>Second, Americans feel threatened by the increasing interdependence of the United States on other countries. As recent headlines have warned, “The era of American global dominance is over” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-24" target="_blank">24</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-25" target="_blank">25</a>). Whether such headlines are true remains debatable (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-26" target="_blank">26</a>), but the perception of a threat to US global dominance is very real. For example, in 2011, 38% of Americans endorsed the view that “[t]he US stands above all other countries in the world” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-27" target="_blank">27</a>); by 2014, that same percentage was down to 28% (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-27" target="_blank">27</a>). This drop has been most precipitous among Republicans. The “China threat” in particular looms large in many American minds (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-28" target="_blank">28</a>).</p><p>Although economists see globalization as mutually beneficial to countries that participate, Americans increasingly feel that they are not getting their fair share. For example, roughly one-half of Americans view trade as something that benefits job availability in other countries at the expense of jobs for Americans (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-29" target="_blank">29</a>). To the extent that the public views the global economy in zero-sum terms, the rise of countries, such as China and India, represents a threat to America’s dominant status. Interestingly, whites’ perceptions of antiblack and antiwhite bias also are also zero sum: that is, the less antiblack bias that whites perceive in a given decade, the greater the antiwhite bias that is perceived (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-30" target="_blank">30</a>).</p><p>Racial status threat and global status threat are technically separable, but they are difficult to distinguish in practice. Because white male Christians are seen as most prototypically “American” (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-31" target="_blank">31</a>), they have the most to lose psychologically if they perceive America and/or whites to be no longer dominant. Given that the 2016 election featured discussions of perceived threats from religious minorities, racial minorities, and foreigners, this generalized sense of threat is likely to have spilled over into multiple arenas. For white Americans, the political consequences of racial and global status threat seem to point in similar directions with respect to issue positions: opposition to immigration, rejection of international trade relationships, and perceptions of China as a threat to American wellbeing.</p><p>For two of these three issues—trade and China—trends in public opinion clearly support the thesis of increased threat between 2012 and 2016 (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-32" target="_blank">32</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-33" target="_blank">33</a>). For immigration, however, multiple sources instead suggest increasingly supportive attitudes among Republicans and Democrats alike (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-34" target="_blank">34</a>). Likewise, to the extent that immigration is perceived as threatening by Americans, scholars find that it is due to the increased economic burden Americans believe immigrants place on the social welfare system rather than a threat to white status (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-35" target="_blank">35</a>). Nonetheless, it remains possible that the heightened salience of immigration contributed to Trump’s victory without increasing actual opposition to immigration, consistent with previous findings attributing preference changes to the increased salience of immigration (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-3" target="_blank">3</a>).</p><p>How plausible is status threat—whether from a sense of declining racial or global status—as an explanation for changes in voting behavior in 2016? With respect to global status threat, the received wisdom from decades of research has long been that “voting ends at water’s edge.” In other words, outside of foreign wars, international affairs are assumed to have little if any electoral importance (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-36" target="_blank">36</a>). However, economic globalization has gained prominence in recent years (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-37" target="_blank">37</a>). Racial status threat makes perfect sense occurring immediately after 8 y of leadership by America’s first African American president. It is not racism of the kind suggesting that whites view minorities as morally or intellectually inferior, but rather, one that regards minorities as sufficiently powerful to be a threat to the status quo. When members of a dominant group experience a sense of threat to their group’s position, whether it is the status of Americans in the world at large or the status of whites in a multiethnic America, change in people’s sense of their group’s relative position produces insecurity.</p><p>Despite multiculturalism’s ostensible goal of inclusion, experimental studies suggest that it is experienced by whites as a form of status threat that produces more negative attitudes toward outgroups of all kinds (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-38" target="_blank">38</a>). Simply reminding whites about their impending loss of majority status produces feelings of threat in experimental studies (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-39" target="_blank">39</a>), particularly among those who think of the “American way of life” as being white (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-40" target="_blank">40</a>). Consequences of exposure to information about impending majority–minority status have included increased conservatism and greater identification with the Republican Party (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-41" target="_blank">41</a>) and the Tea Party (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-42" target="_blank">42</a>), increased opposition to diversity (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-41" target="_blank">41</a>), greater explicit and implicit racial bias, and a stronger preference for interacting with one’s own race (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-43" target="_blank">43</a>). In one study, reminding participants about the upcoming racial shift also produced increased support for Trump among both Democrats and Republicans in a white convenience sample (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-44" target="_blank">44</a>).</p><h2>Research Design</h2><p>A nationally representative panel survey was used to evaluate two central hypotheses. First, does being left behind with respect to personal financial wellbeing predict change in the direction of Republican support in 2016? Second, did issue positions reflecting perceived status threat, whether racial or global, increase the likelihood of shifting toward the Republican presidential candidate in 2016? The panel study includes identical questions asked of the same individuals in both October 2012 and 2016, thus making it possible to examine both whether these opinions weighed more heavily in vote choice in 2016 and/or whether change over time in issue opinions corresponds to change over time in Republican vs. Democratic candidate support. By analyzing both processes simultaneously, I eliminate the potential for confounding these two explanations.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, I constructed two dependent variables, both coded in the direction of support for the Republican candidate. They included (<em>i</em>) feeling thermometer advantage for the Republican candidate relative to the Democratic candidate (that is, the relative feelings of warmth vs. coldness toward the two candidates as assessed by questions asking how warm or cold they feel toward each) and (<em>ii</em>) Republican vs. Democratic vote choice (that is, the respondent’s self-reported vote choice specifically among those who voted for the major party candidates and who were independently verified to have voted in 2016) (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank"><em>Panel Survey</em></a>).</p><p>To assess the left behind thesis, I include change over time in family income, whether the respondent is looking for work, and their subjective perceptions of family finances. To the extent that Trump gained support from those left behind, those experiencing either personal economic decline or increases that do not keep pace with the nation as a whole should be more likely to shift in the Republican direction in 2016. An additional left behind question asked whether the respondent believes that trade in particular has influenced his or her family financial situation in a positive or negative direction.</p><p>Each person was matched to the percentage civilian unemployment, percentage manufacturing employment, and median income based on current zip code. Those in areas dominated by manufacturing with low median incomes and high unemployment should be most drawn to Trump on the basis of community economic hardship.</p><p>Although the panel does not include repeated measures asking directly about racial status threat—and such measures might be susceptible to social desirability bias in any case—it included a short form of the social dominance orientation (SDO) scale (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-45" target="_blank">45</a>), tapping individual differences in support for hierarchy over equality. Psychologists most often use it as an indicator of a stable personal trait indicating animus toward outgroups, but those high in SDO also are known to oppose trade and foreign direct investment out of a desire to dominate other countries (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-29" target="_blank">29</a>). Most importantly, individual levels of SDO are known to increase when people feel threatened (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-46" target="_blank">46</a><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-47" target="_blank"><u>⇓</u></a>–<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-48" target="_blank">48</a>) and to decline when they feel less threatened (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-49" target="_blank">49</a>). Thus, increasing levels of SDO indicate increasing group status threat.</p><p>To tap the extent to which people feel threatened by the world beyond national borders, questions were asked in both presidential election years about support for international trade, support for immigration, and whether the US relationship with China is a threat or an opportunity. In addition to asking for respondents’ own opinions on these issues using seven-point scales, they also were asked for their perceptions of where the Republican and Democratic candidates stood on these issues. Perceived distance measures were created by taking the absolute value of the difference between the self-placement and the candidate placement in both 2012 and 2016. This allowed the over-time analysis simultaneously to take into account changes in personal issue opinions from 2012 to 2016 as well as shifts in where the Republican and Democratic candidates were perceived on these same scales.</p><p>With issue placements of this kind, in cross-sectional analyses, there is a risk that respondents will assimilate the positions of the candidate that they prefer and/or contrast the views of the opponent (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-50" target="_blank">50</a>). Assimilation/contrast renders the perceived distance of candidates endogenous to candidate preferences. Fortunately, this issue is less problematic with repeated measure analyses of panel data. Because each respondent is compared with himself or herself at a previous point in time, any tendency to assimilate or contrast will occur at both points in time, thus canceling itself out when looking at the difference in distances from candidates from one election to the next.</p><p>Notably, all three of these issues capture potential racial and global status threat. For example, immigration captures the perceived threat of allowing those who are racially different into one’s country. Trade opposition captures Americans’ fear of takeover by more dominant economic powers as well as racial opposition based on resentment of “others,” including foreigners and businesses in countries that are racially different (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-51" target="_blank">51</a>). Prejudicial attitudes toward domestic minorities predict trade attitudes more strongly than the vulnerability of a person’s occupation or industry of employment (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-52" target="_blank">52</a>). Finally, China can be considered an outgroup threat both racially and with respect to threatening American global dominance.</p><p>Fixed effects panel analyses provide the most rigorous test of causality possible with observational data. Because the goal is understanding what changed from 2012 to 2016 to facilitate greater support for Trump in 2016 than Mitt Romney in 2012, I estimate the effects of time-varying independent variables to determine whether changes in the independent variables produce changes in candidate choice without needing to fully specify a model including all possible influences on candidate preference. Significant coefficients thus represent evidence that change in an independent variable corresponds to change in the dependent variable at the individual level. In addition, the net change over time in these independent variables must be in the direction helping to explain increased support for Trump.</p><p>To examine whether heightened issue salience accounts for changing preferences, I include in the models measures of respondents’ pre-Trump opinions on these measures interacted with a dichotomous wave variable. These independent variable by wave interactions should be significant to the extent that the salience of these issue opinions was increased by the 2016 campaign, so that they weighed more heavily in individual vote choice in 2016 than in 2012. For example, if those who shifted toward Trump in 2016 were people who already opposed trade in 2012 and Trump simply exploited those preexisting views for electoral advantage, this would be confirmed by a significant interaction between SDO and wave.</p><p>To the extent that changes in issue salience are responsible for changing presidential preferences, the interaction coefficients should be significant; to the extent that changing public opinions and/or changing candidate positions also account for changing presidential vote preferences, the coefficients corresponding to these independent variables will be significant. For the continuous outcome, Republican feeling thermometer advantage, I use ordinary fixed effects regression. For the dichotomous measure of Republican candidate preference, I use an ordered logit fixed effects model.</p><p>Fixed effects analysis of panel data provides a stringent test of these hypotheses for two reasons. First, these models produce conservative estimates of effects due to larger SEs. Second, because party identification is known to account for most of the variance in candidate preference, by including it in the model and allowing it to vary over time, there is very little change in the dependent variable left to be explained by other factors.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>Party identification contributes stability to the two-party vote, and 2016 was no exception. Overwhelmingly, most voters simply voted for the candidate of the same party in both 2012 and 2016. (If one considers only those voters who reported voting for one of the major party candidates in both years, party loyalty seems quite strong, with 92% of panelists who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 also voting for Clinton in 2016. Among those who voted for the Democratic candidate as opposed to any other candidate in both years, 86% of those who voted for Obama in 2012 also voted for Clinton in 2016.) Despite the fact that 2016 is widely considered a nontraditional election, party loyalty was as important as ever. More to the point, party identification sets a very high bar for explaining any remaining variance in vote choice.</p><p><br></p><h3>Change over Time in Opinions and Perceptions.</h3><p>The assumption that respondents’ views were essentially stable over time is incorrect (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a>). Consistent with the hypothesis that threat leads to greater conservatism, the average party identification for Americans shifted in a slightly but significantly more Republican direction from 2012 to 2016. Also consistent with the threat thesis, the American public became significantly more negative in its views of international trade from 2012 to 2016, and this declining support was especially severe among Republicans (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a>). SDO rose significantly from 2012 to 2016, indicating an increased perception of threat to dominant groups.</p><p>However, in contrast to an increased sense of threat from immigration but consistent with other surveys, the average American became more supportive of a path to citizenship between 2012 and 2016 (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-34" target="_blank">34</a>). This change occurred among people identifying with both parties, but it was especially pronounced among Democrats (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a>). Levels of perceived threat from China did not change significantly over this 4-y period. China was already viewed as threatening in 2012, and levels of threat did not increase in the population as a whole or among members of either party.</p><p>Beyond opinion change among the mass public, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#F1" target="_blank">Fig. 1</a> illustrates the particularly large shifts that occurred over time in how the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates were perceived on these issues (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a>). For example, in 2012, the two parties’ candidate positions on trade as well as the average American’s position were all indistinguishable, directly in the middle of the seven-point scale. However, by 2016, the distance between the Democratic placement and that of the average American became more than twice the distance between the Republican candidate and the average American. In other words, the Democratic position on trade became far less tenable for the average American than the Republican position. For perceptions of China as a threat, the Republican candidates’ positions remained the same distance from the average American, but the Democratic position became increasingly distant from the average American. Immigration attitudes became more polarized, with Republican candidate position perceived as more antiimmigration and the Democratic position perceived as slightly more positive.</p><p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank"><img width="381" height="440" alt="Fig. 1." src="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F1.medium.gif">&amp;lt;img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Fig. 1." src="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F1.medium.gif" width="381" height="440"/&amp;gt;</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F1.large.jpg?download=true" target="_blank">Download figure</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F1.large.jpg" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/highwire/powerpoint/805956" target="_blank">Download powerpoint</a></li></ul><p>Fig. 1.Issue positions of self (average voter) and perceptions of Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, 2012–2016.

In each case, a single regression equation is used to evaluate both the impact of changes in issue salience and candidate issue positions. The extent to which within-person change over time in a given independent variable predicts an individual’s likelihood of change in the dependent variable is shown in columns 2 and 6 in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>.

Both dependent variables are coded in the direction of higher relative thermometer ratings for the Republican presidential candidate or greater probability of Republican vote in the fixed effects logit regression in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>.</p><p>View this table:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115##" target="_blank">View inline</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/highwire/markup/805973/expansion?width=1000&amp;height=500&amp;iframe=true&amp;postprocessors=highwire_tables%2Chighwire_reclass%2Chighwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media%2Chighwire_embed" target="_blank">View popup</a></li></ul><p>Table 1.Predicting change in presidential support from 2012 to 2016: Fixed effects analysis</p><p>Not surprisingly, the shift toward greater identification with the Republican Party from 2012 to 2016 predicted greater support for the Republican candidate in both analyses. Although many suspected that party identification mattered less in 2016 than in 2012, the analyses of issue salience show that this was not the case. The most obvious finding in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, there is little to no evidence that those whose incomes declined or whose incomes increased to a lesser extent than others’ incomes were more likely to support Trump. Even change in subjective assessment of one’s own personal financial situation had no discernible impact on evaluations of Trump or on change in vote choice. Likewise, those who lost a job between 2012 and 2016 were no more likely to support Trump. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> further suggests that change over time in the extent to which a person perceived that trade had influenced his or her family financial situation made no difference to candidate attitudes or preferences.</p><p>Across all relevant predictors, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> also provides no evidence that the increased salience of personal economic considerations played a role in increasing Trump’s support relative to Romney. Furthermore, respondents’ immediate geographic context, including unemployment and manufacturing concentration, made no difference, with the sole exception that living in an area with a high median income positively predicted Republican vote choice to a greater extent in 2016; this is precisely the opposite of what one would expect based on the left behind thesis. To examine the possibility that the impact of change in personal financial indicators was masked by including other sources of change in these analyses, I reestimated these models and included only the economic predictors (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S3</a>). Results reaffirmed the findings in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>.</p><p>Changes over time in indicators tied to racial/global status threat were far more influential as predictors of change toward greater Republican thermometer advantage and as predictors of greater likelihood of Republican vote choice. As shown in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>, increases in SDO significantly predicted changes in Republican vote choice as well as Republican thermometer advantage. When a person’s desire for group dominance increased from 2012 to 2016, so did the probability of defecting to Trump. However, as shown by the insignificant interaction between SDO and wave in both analyses, there is no evidence that those high in preexisting SDO were especially likely to defect to Trump, thus countering the idea that SDO was made more salient in 2016. Instead, it is the increase in SDO, which is indicative of status threat, that corresponded to increasing positivity toward Trump.</p><p>Mass opinion changes on status threat-related issues were not, by themselves, the driving force in increasing affinity for the Republican candidate. Instead, increasing relative distance from the Democratic candidate on threat-related issues, such as immigration and China, consistently predicted Trump support in a positive direction, whereas decreasing relative distance from the Republican candidate on trade and China also predicted change in the direction of voting for Trump. These consistently significant coefficients indicate that change over time in the candidates’ perceived positions relative to those of individual respondents had a significant impact in increasing support for Trump. The pattern in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> makes it clear that it was change in how the candidates positioned themselves on status threat-related issues combined with smaller changes in public issue opinions that predicted increasing support for the Republican candidate in 2016.</p><p>The greater the distance from the Democratic candidate on trade, immigration, and China relative to that same distance in 2012, the more likely they were to defect toward Trump; the more the distance from the Republican candidate increased on these same issues, the less likely they were to shift toward Trump. Thus, changing respondent opinions in combination with realignments by the candidates on these same issues combined to make them important to changing candidate preferences. The large significant coefficient associated with perceived change in the national economy is consistent with the idea that those perceiving the economy as improving were less likely to defect toward the Republicans; however, national economic perceptions are well-known to be rationalized from candidate preferences, thus raising serious suspicions about endogeneity (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-53" target="_blank">53</a>).</p><p>The analyses in the presidential vote choice columns in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> show what changed in predictors of vote choice among those validated to have actually voted in 2016 who reported voting for one of the two major party candidates. These voters are obviously most important to what happened in 2016. In addition to shifting party identification, which fueled shifts toward the Republican candidate, voters who shifted to become Trump voters between the two elections seem to have done so because of increasing distance between their own views and those of the Democratic candidate on trade, immigration, and China as well as due to the decreasing distance between their own views and those of the Republican candidate. These large significant coefficients suggest that these issues were important engines of change. In addition, those whose SDO level increased, indicating a rising sense of threat to the dominant group’s status, were particularly likely to shift in support of Trump.</p><p>What is perhaps most interesting about <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> is what it reveals about the appropriate theoretical model for understanding shifting vote preferences from one election to the next. The dominant theoretical model for understanding electoral changes has long been that campaigns change vote choice not so much by changing opinions but by making some issues more salient than others, thus advantaging one candidate over another. However, based on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>, this does not seem to be the case. A quick glance down the columns representing the issue salience results (that is, the interactions between 2012 values of these predictors and wave) provides no evidence that changes in vote choice from 2012 to 2016 were a function of changing issue salience. The only significant coefficient suggests that areas higher in percentage manufacturing employment were less likely to shift toward Trump.</p><h3>Net Change.</h3><p>Estimating effect sizes using fixed effects analysis is more complex, because one must take into account not only the size of the fixed effects coefficients representing the effects of change on change but also, the extent to which the amount and direction of over-time change in a given variable are ones that help to explain increases as opposed to decreases in support for the Republican candidate. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a> summarizes the extent and direction of change over time in each of the independent variables. For example, party identification shifted slightly in the Republican direction, consistent with the idea that threat generally leads to more conservative views. Economic changes are consistent with what one would expect during an economic upturn. Thus, even if changes in pocketbook variables had predicted change in Republican candidate support (which they did not), their net impact would have been decreasing Republican candidate support.</p><p>Drawing on the analysis of vote choice among validated voters in model 2 in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>, I estimated total net change due to each significant independent variable for the model predicting changing vote choice from 2012 to 2016. To assess net effects, I computed the predicted probabilities of change using the fixed effects model and then evaluated the impact of the average extent of change between 2012 and 2016 in each of these independent variables while holding all other variables at their wave 0 means. The difference between the wave 0 and wave 1 probabilities provides the marginal impact of one variable (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S2</a>). These estimates represent how the predicted probabilities change as one variable of interest goes from its wave 0 to wave 1 mean value. It takes into account both the extent of change in that variable that occurred on average, and the strength of change in this variable in predicting change in Republican vote choice. For ease of interpretation, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#F2" target="_blank">Fig. 2</a> combines the two candidate distance estimates for each issue.</p><p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank"><img width="440" height="183" alt="Fig. 2." src="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F2.medium.gif">&amp;lt;img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Fig. 2." src="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F2.medium.gif" width="440" height="183"/&amp;gt;</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F2.large.jpg?download=true" target="_blank">Download figure</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F2.large.jpg" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/highwire/powerpoint/805950" target="_blank">Download powerpoint</a></li></ul><p>Fig. 2.Net change in predicted probability of Republican vs. Democratic vote, 2012–2016. Note that bars represent change in predicted probability of voting for the Republican in 2016 vs. 2012 among validated voters. Calculations were based on predicted values from the regression model (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>) when setting the variable of interest at its wave 0 and wave 1 means (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a>) and calculating the difference in probabilities of a Republican vote while holding all other variables at their wave 0 means. Positive values indicate increasing probabilities of a Republican vote choice.</p><p>Although the extent of change due to any one variable is limited, the candidates’ changing relative positions on trade account for the greatest net impact on Trump support. By 2016, the Democratic candidate had become much farther away from the average American on this issue. This increasing distance combined with a large coefficient indicating its impact on change in vote choice meant that trade views increased the probability of voting for Trump by almost 0.05. China threat also increased the Republican candidate’s advantage to a lesser extent, roughly one-half the magnitude of trade’s impact. Not surprisingly, immigration hurt Republican vote choice more than it helped, mainly because relative to Democratic candidates, Trump moved farther away from voters whose more moderate positions on this issue were closer to those of Romney in 2012 than Trump in 2016. The marginal effect of shifting party identification accounted for another 0.01–0.02 increase in the predicted probability of voting for the Republican candidate. Although these few issues are not intended to account for all changes between 2012 and 2016 that might have brought about a change in vote choice, given the narrow margins of victory in many states, their effects could have substantial consequences.</p><p>Rising SDO accounted for another 0.01 increase in the probability of voting for the Republican candidate. It is also possible that it had indirect effects on people’s issue positions, since opposition to trade and perceptions of China as a threat are known to be fueled by levels of and increases in SDO (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-29" target="_blank">29</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-51" target="_blank">51</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-52" target="_blank">52</a>). In short, perceptions of Republican candidate issue positions in 2016 were altered in what were more appealing, status threat-defensive directions for the average voter. The shift toward an antitrade stance was a particularly effective strategy for capitalizing on a public experiencing status threat due to race as well as globalization.</p><h2>Replication and Extensions</h2><p>To replicate key findings and address unanswered questions, I used an independent cross-sectional survey from October 2016, a representative national probability sample collected by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank"><em>Cross-Sectional Survey</em></a>). Despite the inherent limitations of cross-sectional data for causal inference, results largely reinforced the interpretations suggested by the panel analyses.</p><p><br></p><h3>Pocketbook Voting.</h3><p>To what extent are these results convincing with respect to the lack of effects from personal economic hardship? Could Trump’s popularity be due to anticipated future financial difficulties rather than a referendum on what had already occurred? Cross-sectional analyses allowed me to examine the possibility that economic anxiety about the future was related to Trump support. Three questions explicitly asked respondents about their concern over (<em>i</em>) not having saved enough for retirement, (<em>ii</em>) not being able to pay medical bills, and (<em>iii</em>) not being able to pay for educational expenses. As shown in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S4</a>, whether using the sample as a whole or whites only, the results are the same. Concern about future expenses does not predict greater support for Trump. In addition, Trump supporters favor a smaller safety net, contradicting expectations that they are concerned about those facing economic hardship. Consistent with panel evidence, there is little support for the left behind thesis from the cross-sectional indicators of past economic hardship or anticipated hardship.</p><h3>Perceived Status Threat.</h3><p>Another limitation in the panel analyses is that I do not provide direct evidence that dominant groups feel threatened. Instead, I infer this from rising SDO and changing issue attitudes that suggest hunkering down in a protective manner. To address this shortcoming, the cross-sectional data illustrate how dominant group membership affected Trump support as well as whether those who reported that dominant groups were threatened were more likely to support Trump. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S4</a> further confirms that whites and men were more likely to support Trump. More to the point, feeling that “the American way of life is threatened” is a consistent predictor of Trump support. In addition, respondents were asked to what extent various groups in America were discriminated against, including Christians, Muslims, men, women, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. If threat to dominant group status is an underlying cause of Trump support, the extent to which people perceive dominant social groups, such as men, Christians, and whites, as discriminated against more than lower status groups should predict support for Trump. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S4</a> shows that perceived discrimination against high-status groups does indeed have a substantial impact on the likelihood of supporting Trump, even in a fully saturated model. Largely, the same individuals who perceive whites as more discriminated against than minorities also see Christians and men as experiencing greater discrimination than Muslims and women, despite the former groups’ dominant status. The status threat explanation is thus consistent with others’ interpretations emphasizing gender, race, and religion (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-3" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-5" target="_blank">5</a>). Furthermore, indicators that were present in both datasets, such as SDO, opinions on trade, and threat from China, produced similar results, adding confidence to this interpretation.</p><h3>The Meaning of Education.</h3><p>The cross-sectional survey replicates the strong relationship with education shown throughout the election. More importantly, it provides a better understanding of what precisely education represents. In <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S5</a>, model 1, I replicate the strong relationship between lack of college education and Trump support using only demographics as predictors. In model 2, I examine what happens to education’s predictive power when measures of personal economic wellbeing are also included in the model. Finally, in model 3, I drop the economic variables and instead, include indicators corresponding to status threat toward dominant groups. As summarized in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#F3" target="_blank">Fig. 3</a>, regardless of which outcome measures I examined, including indicators of economic status did not eliminate the impact of education. It reduced education’s impact somewhat for the feeling thermometer measure, but for Trump/Clinton vote, the impact of education remained constant. However, after the relationship between Trump support and perceived status threat is taken into account, even lack of a college education no longer predicts Trump support for any of the measures. These findings strongly suggest that group-based status threat was the main reason that those without college educations were more supportive of Trump.</p><p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F3.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank"><img width="440" height="189" alt="Fig. 3." src="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F3.medium.gif">&amp;lt;img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Fig. 3." src="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F3.medium.gif" width="440" height="189"/&amp;gt;</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F3.large.jpg?download=true" target="_blank">Download figure</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/04/18/1718155115/F3.large.jpg" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pnas.org/highwire/powerpoint/805942" target="_blank">Download powerpoint</a></li></ul><p>Fig. 3.Status threat accounts for the impact of education on the 2016 presidential election. Note that bars represent the predictive strength of education on each of three different outcome measures after taking into account (<em>i</em>) demographics alone, (<em>ii</em>) demographics and economic predictors only, and (<em>iii</em>) demographics and threat indicators only. Details are in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S5</a>. ***<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001.</p><h2>Threats to Causal Inference</h2><p>The overall consistency of these two sets of findings from two independent surveys lends strong support to the conclusion that the 2016 election was not about economic hardship. Instead, it was about dominant groups that felt threatened by change and a candidate who took advantage of that trend by positioning himself closer than his opponent to Americans’ positions on status threat-related issues.</p><p>Panel data utilizing within-person change over time are ideal for purposes of statistically identifying the relatively small changes that can change the outcome of American elections. Although model specification issues are much less problematic with this approach, it does not eliminate the possibility of confounding that is both unmeasured and time varying. In other words, if the impact of some variables is stronger at one point in time than another, model estimates can be biased. The consistent lack of significant interactions found between these independent variables and time diminishes this possibility, although it can never be completely eliminated.</p><p>Reverse causation is also possible, although it is unlikely in this context for several reasons. Reverse causation would mean that former supporters of the Democratic presidential candidate in 2012 shifted to support the Republican in 2016 for reasons completely unrelated to the substance of these analyses. After they had shifted to support Trump for other reasons, one could argue that opinion leadership by Trump induced opinions on these issues to become more like his positions. In other words, change in candidate preference drove change in issue opinions. Although evidence of elite opinion leadership is common, it generally occurs because people change opinions toward the opinions held by the party and elites that they have long supported. The leaders of one’s party espouse issue positions that rank and file party members subsequently adopt. I am unaware of evidence of opinion leadership by outparty leaders. Respondents would need to have changed their minds to support Trump both for unrelated reasons and well in advance of him being able to exercise opinion leadership over them. Strong commitments facilitate opinion leadership, but nascent, weak commitments are unlikely to do so.</p><p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence against interpreting this evidence as opinion leadership by Trump comes from the panel findings themselves. Only for trade is there evidence of the public shifting in the same direction as Trump (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#F1" target="_blank">Fig. 1</a> and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S1</a>). For China, mass opinions did not change at all among either partisan group, and for immigration, they changed in the direction opposite of Trump’s views. In addition, as illustrated in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#T1" target="_blank">Table 1</a>, change over time in individuals’ issue opinions did not correspond to change over time in support for the Republican candidate. If opinion leadership was occurring, these two changes over time should certainly covary, yet they do not. Instead, it is the combination of changing personal opinions and independently assessed changing perceptions of the positions of the party leadership that combined to alter vote choice.</p><p>One exception is SDO, where it is plausible that increasing levels of SDO produce shifts in favor of Trump as well as that becoming a Trump supporter could cause increased SDO. Again, change in candidate preference from 2012 to 2016 would need to have occurred for reasons unrelated to this model, and Trump’s popularity would need to have subsequently caused increased SDO specifically among new Trump supporters. Whether this is a more plausible explanation than group status threat increasing support for a candidate emphasizing protectionist and prodominant status group policies remains to be seen. To date, SDO has been documented to increase strictly when group boundaries are made salient and people’s group status is threatened (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-46" target="_blank">46</a><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-47" target="_blank"><u>⇓</u></a>–<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-48" target="_blank">48</a>).</p><p>Contrary to one previous study, I do not find that the increased salience of immigration (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-3" target="_blank">3</a>) or that changing opinions on immigration fueled additional Trump support. Although these surveys, as others, show that immigration views are correlated with racial animus and SDO, status threat is not the usual form of prejudice or stereotyping that involves looking down on outgroups who are perceived to be inferior; instead, it is borne of a sense that the outgroup is doing too well and thus, is a viable threat to one’s own dominant group status. As a highly visible indicator of racial progress, a well-educated, Harvard Law-trained African American president is indeed threatening to dominant white status (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-54" target="_blank">54</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-55" target="_blank">55</a>), whereas immigrants arriving with nothing but the clothes on their backs apparently are not. For a dominant group to be threatened by an outgroup, the outgroup needs to be perceived as powerful. Traditional racial stereotypes of poor, uneducated, or unintelligent minority groups do not fuel the sense that one’s dominant group status is being challenged. As a result, immigration is unlikely to trigger dominant group status threat, particularly in a country with relatively few new immigrants. However, a sense of threat is triggered by racial progress in a majority–minority America; an increasingly powerful country, such as China; or an America that is no longer the dominant economic superpower. The rising sense of racial and global threat in the United States could not be more opportune for a candidate seeking to capitalize on status threat-based issues.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Narratives are important, because they structure people’s understanding of what has occurred and why. They also guide the behavior of elected representatives in deciding how to represent their constituencies. When the people have spoken, the postelection narrative decides what it is they have said. Based on these results, it would be a mistake for people to understand the 2016 election as resulting from the frustration of those left behind economically. Instead, both experimental evidence and panel survey evidence document significant political consequences from a rising sense of status threat among dominant groups in the United States.</p><p>Lack of a college education was persistently noted as the strongest predictor of Trump support. This pattern led journalists with limited data toward economic explanations. However, education is also the strongest predictor of support for international trade, a relationship that is not tied to income or occupation so much as ethnocentrism (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-52" target="_blank">52</a>). Negative attitudes toward racial and ethnic diversity are also correlated with low levels of education. In this election, education represented group status threat rather than being left behind economically. Those who felt that the hierarchy was being upended—with whites discriminated against more than blacks, Christians discriminated against more than Muslims, and men discriminated against more than women—were most likely to support Trump.</p><p>Why does it matter whether Trump’s support was driven by being left behind economically as opposed to a sense that one’s status in the domestic or international hierarchy has suffered? Some workers obviously have suffered financially, even if the general trend is toward improvement. However, these losses were not politicized when it came to voting in 2016. Trump’s victory may be viewed more admirably when it is attributed to a groundswell of support from previously ignored workers than when it is attributed to those whose status is threatened by minorities and foreign countries. More importantly, elected officials who embrace the left behind narrative may feel compelled to pursue policies that will do little to assuage the fears of less educated Americans. Furthermore, Trump’s “us vs. them” rhetoric does little to lead whites and minorities or Americans and foreigners to view one another in less threatening ways, and it calls to whites’ attention the fact that they are already doing quite well relative to minority groups and relative to those in the countries that they often find threatening.</p><p>The left behind thesis has focused attention on economically beleaguered victims of trade-related job loss. While this group certainly deserves public support, misunderstanding the election narrative still has potentially negative consequences. Most manufacturing job loss is not related to trade (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-56" target="_blank">56</a>). Furthermore, Trump’s supporters largely oppose strengthening the safety net for those left behind (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718155115/-/DCSupplemental" target="_blank">Table S4</a>). Those concerned with left-behind sectors are likely to be disappointed if they expect the current administration and its supporters to prioritize the economically beleaguered manufacturing sector.</p><p>The 2016 election was a result of anxiety about dominant groups’ future status rather than a result of being overlooked in the past. In many ways, a sense of group threat is a much tougher opponent than an economic downturn, because it is a psychological mindset rather than an actual event or misfortune. Given current demographic trends within the United States, minority influence will only increase with time, thus heightening this source of perceived status threat. Although whites will likely still be the best-educated and most well-off racial group, by 2040, they are unlikely to dominate in numbers. Likewise, despite US status as an extremely wealthy country relative to those countries perceived to threaten it economically, many Americans find that small comfort.</p><p>These results also directly refute the long-held belief among political scientists that political elites “waltz before a blind audience” when it comes to international issues (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-36" target="_blank">36</a>). Public opinion on trade in particular has been assumed not to matter, because politicians are not held accountable for low salience issues (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/04/18/1718155115#ref-57" target="_blank">57</a>). Trump’s emphasis on these particular issues in his campaign increased the salience of international affairs. In politicizing these issues, he put greater distance between the candidates of the two parties on international issues. Elections are always structured by the candidates who happen to be in play at the time. However, in 2016, large changes in the nominees’ issue positions relative to their predecessors in the previous election made this an especially important factor. Because globalization itself is unlikely to wane, these are likely to remain important electoral issues for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Most critically, these results speak to the importance of group status in the formation of political preferences. Political uprisings are often about downtrodden groups rising up to assert their right to better treatment and more equal life conditions relative to high-status groups. The 2016 election, in contrast, was an effort by members of already dominant groups to assure their continued dominance and by those in an already powerful and wealthy country to assure its continued dominance.</p><h2>Materials and Methods</h2><p>The representative national probability surveys used in this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania. All data are available at <a href="http://iscap.asc.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/Mutz_PNAS_Replication_Data_and_Code.zip" target="_blank">iscap.asc.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/Mutz_PNAS_Replication_Data_and_Code.zip</a>. Both waves of panel data were collected online by GfK Ltd., formerly known as Knowledge Networks. The need for a separate informed consent procedure was waived, because the company administers a consent procedure when people initially join the panel. Those recruited for the sample who lacked online access were given free internet to ensure that all had the same initial probability of being included in the sample. Voter validation for panel respondents was purchased from Catalist, LLC after the election. The panel survey included just over 1,200 participants who responded in both waves.</p><p>Cross-sectional data were gathered by Amerispeak of the NORC at the University of Chicago from October 14 to 28, 2016 (<em>n</em> = 3,214). Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish either online or by telephone depending on respondent preference. Current Population Surveys data on area median income, unemployment, and percentage manufacturing employment were supplied by the vendor and matched to each respondent’s zip code under a Data Use Agreement between the NORC and the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>I thank the American Politics Working Group at the University of Pennsylvania for their suggestions.

    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>I want to add a tool bar to embed this youtube video. Just another thing I want to do </p><p>I can paste a <a href="https://www.space.com/41749-elon-musk-living-in-simulation-rogan-podcast.html" target="_blank">link</a> to this article.  Maybe that's enough.  I can cut and paste parts of other web pages. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&lt;div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:61.73%"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ycPr5-27vSI?ecver=2" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" width="583" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p><p><br></p><p>The universe is 13.8 billion years old, so any civilizations that may have arisen throughout the cosmos have had loads and loads of time to hone their technological know-how, the SpaceX founder and CEO explained early this morning (Sept. 7) during a long, wide-ranging and very entertaining appearance on comedian Joe Rogan's popular podcast, "</p><p><br></p><p>The Joe Rogan Experience."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>"If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of those two things will occur," Musk said. "Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation, <a href="https://www.space.com/41749-elon-musk-living-in-simulation-rogan-podcast.html" target="_blank">because we exist</a>."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>"Why would you make a simulation that's boring? You'd make a simulation that's way more interesting than base reality," Musk said, citing the video games and movies that humanity makes, which are "distillation[s] of what's interesting about life."</p><p><br></p><p>The billionaire entrepreneur is far from alone in this interpretation; a number of physicists, cosmologists and philosophers find the simulation hypothesis compelling. If even one advanced alien civilization with a predilection for creating simulations has ever arisen out there, the reasoning goes, then it could theoretically pop off thousands — or perhaps even millions or billions — of "fake" universes. And it would be hard for the inhabitants of these digital realms to figure out the truth, because all the evidence they could gather would likely be planted by the creators.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Indeed, the simulation idea is one of many possible explanations for the famous Fermi paradox, which basically asks, "Where is everybody?" ("Everybody" being aliens, of course.)</p><p><br></p><p>This was far from the only ground that Musk and Rogan covered during their 2.5-hour conversation. For example, Musk reiterated his concerns about unregulated and uncontrolled artificial intelligence; stressed that a bright and appealing future for humanity involves exploring and settling other worlds, both in our solar system and beyond; and discussed the traffic-reducing potential of extensive tunnel systems, which his Boring Company aims to build in big cities around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Musk also talked at length about Tesla, the electric-car company he runs, and the need for our species to wean itself off fossil fuels. Musk described humanity's mass displacement of carbon from the ground to the atmosphere (and from there into the oceans) as an incredibly dangerous experiment whose ultimate outcome is unknown.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>"We should not do this," he told Rogan. "We know that sustainable energy is the end point. So why are we doing this experiment? It's an insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history." [Images of Melt: Earth's Vanishing Ice]</p><p><br></p><p>Musk also casually mentioned that he has an idea for an electric supersonic plane that takes off and lands vertically. But he said he doesn't view the development of this concept as a priority at the moment, given the other pressing problems humanity needs to solve.</p><p><br></p><p>Musk and Rogan sipped whiskey throughout their conversation. And at one point, the comedian lit up a joint, and Musk took a puff.</p><p><br></p><p>This was apparently a rare event; the SpaceX CEO said he almost never smokes marijuana (which is legal in California, where The Joe Rogan Experience is taped) and doesn't enjoy it, because it saps his famous productivity.</p><p><br></p><p>"It's like a cup of coffee in reverse," Musk said. "I like to get things done. I like to be useful."&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>He told Rogan that ideas are bouncing around inside his head all the time — "it's like a never-ending explosion" — and that he realized he was different from other people when he was just 5 or 6 years old.</p><p><br></p><p>"I thought I was insane," Musk said. As a kid, he added, he worried that authority figures might notice his "strangeness" and put him away somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There was so much other interesting stuff as well. For example, Musk appreciatively handled a samurai sword in the studio that Rogan said was 500 years old. And at one point toward the end of the conversation, Musk said, "This may sound corny, but love is the answer." (Another choice quote: "I don't know what would happen if I got in a sensory-deprivation tank. Sounds concerning.")</p><p>You can watch the entire thing on&nbsp;<a style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ" target="_blank">The Joe Rogan Experience's YouTube page</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow Mike Wall on Twitter&nbsp;</em><a style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);" href="http://twitter.com/michaeldwall" target="_blank"><em>@michaeldwall</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/108984047382030613667/posts" target="_blank"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.&nbsp;Follow us&nbsp;</em><a style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);" href="http://twitter.com/spacedotcom" target="_blank"><em>@Spacedotcom</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);" href="https://www.facebook.com/spacecom" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><a style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 102, 204);" href="https://plus.google.com/+SPACEcom/posts" target="_blank"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.

    <Summary>I live in Texas. For the first time my vote really matters. If Beto wins that would be a gain of one for the D's and a loss of one for the R's. That's a flip of two seats. And it's not just that Beto has different political views than his opponent. Beto is a compelling charismatic personality. It really makes a difference if a political candidate has IT. It's hard to say what IT is but you know it when you see it. He's handsome and articulate and passionate. Passion you can feel. And then there's Alexandria.</Summary>

    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>None of this has anything to do with abortion, or at least not all of it. They whip up evangelical fanatics, but think about it, what are they going to do, put investigators in every precinct to investigate your sister's miscarriage. My sister once had a miscarriage. It was a terrible heartbreaking event for her and for all of us. </p><p>Nobody is in favor of or likes abortion. Tearing the vital tissue of a living fetus from a fertile female is an awful thought. But then there's the real world. What about when your daughter, who has a scholarship to Cornell, gets in trouble by some jerk who doesn't love her? Unwanted children have been a 'situation' for centuries. There has always been a hill outside of town where unwanted, rejected, deformed or socially inexpedient little bundles were left for the wolves. For centuries the attitude has been: "It's none of your damn business."</p><p>  Anyway, I'll talk about abortion later. As I was saying, this Kavanaugh appointment, as all republicans desperate for an excuse for Trump freely claim, they value conservative judges and justices for all sorts of reasons. I personally can't fathom their mindset; they are for things that I can't understand. Why is favoring the rich in campaign finance, disemboweling labor, and tax avoidance so important to them? Most conservatives are not rich. That republican politicians are handsomely rewarded by the rich doesn't fully explain their obsession. Or does it? There seems no end to their hypocrisy. Trump has shown that republicans can abandon any position.  What happened to the existential threat poised by the deficit? What happened to the Red Scare, the all consuming fear hatred and competition with Russia? Turns out Russians are white blue eyed and blond. Come to find out it has been all about race the whole time.    </p><p>  Anyway, I'll talk about republican hypocrisy later. But one example of conservative willingness to overlook anything in pursuit of "getting over" on the liberals is the tolerance judge Kavanaugh's character. The guy is as big a scumbag as Trump. Except, this one will be with us for a generation.</p>]]></Contents>

    <Summary>Of all the criminal acts performed by Paul Manafort perhaps the most disastrous and long lasting damage is what he has done to our Constitution. To appreciate the magnitude of the affront we have go back and look at some of the history. And we have to appreciate the word democracy and understand the difference between a Republic and a Democracy. Everyone call the USA a democracy, but if you remember the Pledge of Allegiance from elementary school it's "to the Republic for which it stands". We are supposedly a Republic. What does that mean?  </Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>What's the difference between a democracy and a republic? And what's the big deal?</p><p>Technically, a democracy is when laws are made and decisions are made by direct popular vote, and a republic employs something called representative government. In anything other a small tribe or village, getting everyone to vote on every issue becomes impractical. So the concept of a quorum was devised. An appropriate percentage of citizens can be a representative sample of the popular vote. Eventually you arrive at representative government.  </p><p>  It's a matter of certain knowledge that democracy is the greatest, most wonderful perfect ideal in the history of the world. Republics have all sorts of problems. The elite or other special interests tend to take over control. However, democracies have a few problems too. Our Founding Fathers deliberately created a very specific and rather elaborate form of government which it called a Republic. James Madison's biggest complaint with democracy had to do with his opinion of common people.</p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Bud Lite For The Many Not The Few.</p><p><br></p><p>  But, a republic implies other features. Plato wrote a book considering the ins and outs. </p><p><br></p><p> a quorum of all citizens, and a republic means representative government; government by a quorum elected representatives. What's the big deal? What's the distinction and what's the big deal. It comes down to a fundamental position. Do you consider human beings fundamentally good or fundamentally evil? </p><p>  Actually, it's more insidious than that, especially in this politically correct age of #me too. It's also problematic in light of the "All Men Are Created Equal" statement that young Thomas screed in his Declaration of Independence. Yes, under the law, in the eyes of law all people are should be considered equal, every man women and child. </p><p><br></p><p>But, in reality no two people are created equal, with the possible exception of identical twins raised together.</p><p>  Not only are no two people </p>]]></Contents>

    <Summary>If he wanted to I bet Manafort could tell quite a story. He's been swimming in the swamps for decades. What does he know about other stolen elections by W? What other thousands of dirty dealings on K Street could he tell about? Remember when Bush's Treasury Secretary Paulson performed the greatest daylight bank robbery in history when he vindictively destroyed his arch rival Lehman Brothers? All the lobbying agencies, law firms, political strategic adversary concerns, and so called Think Tanks. All the influence peddlers, the entire culture of lobbying; From his beginnings with the young College Republicans Association, Manafort has been at the heart of the modern    
</Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>Yeah I could tell you a few things. This isn't the first election we've stolen. We stuffed a few ballot boxes in Ohio to defeat John Kerry. We cheated Al Gore out the presidency in Florida. I could tell you some other stuff. Do you want to know about 9-11? The planes had nothing to do with the controlled demolition of the towers. Marvin Bush, the president's brother owned a company that did two unrelated things. It owned a catering agency that pulled trucks up to passenger jets, and a second company that was doing some kind of maintenance and shut off every ninth floor both building of the World Trade Center. They wrapped military grade thermite det cord around every support girder. The Pentagon wasn't hit by a plane. There's no way to maneuver an airplane into the spot where they claim it hit. No debris of a jetliner or bodies were ever found. It was cruise missile strike. Did you ever see the picture of the perfectly round hole in the back of the third ring? There were people in the Pentagon who could tell the difference between the smell of cordite and jet fuel. </p><p>  Do you know how many people work in Pentagon? I'd say about half.</p><p>The plane that crashed in Pennsylvania wasn't brought down by passengers storming the cockpit. There we no cell phone calls let alone one that said "Let's roll." There was no cell phone coverage in airplanes travelling at thirty thousand feet. Recently they have started installing WiFi in planes but before that they had to make up the fake concept of "Airplane Mode" for all devices and the phony argument that they interfered with avionics.</p><p>    "Avionics? Paulie! What are you some kind of rocket scientist?  </p><p>Cheney ordered that plane shot down by a F-16.</p><p>I could tell you lot's of other stuff. Remember Jack Abramoff</p><p><br></p><p> “He believed that suckers stay out of debt,” the colleague told me. His unrestrained spending and pile of debt required a perpetual search for bigger paydays and riskier ventures.</p><p><br></p><p>I apologize to my son and my brother but I am no longer interested in tolerating, trying to accept or even bother to understand Trump conservatives. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>An article in the <strong>Atlantic</strong> makes the argument that the most terrible thing Manafort is responsible for is the bringing the practices of of corrupt countries. That's a nice racist east coast elitist Atlantic Monthly </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/this-is-so-much-bigger-than-paul-manafort/566501/" target="_blank">So much about America’s view of itself </a>resists accepting a disturbing reality. Conventional wisdom long held that America’s free market would never tolerate the sort of clientelism, nepotism, and outright theft that prevailed in places like Brazil and Italy. Americans thought that globalization would export the hygienic habits of this nation’s financial system and its values of good government to the rest of the world. But over the past three decades, the opposite transpired: America has become the sanctuary of choice for laundered money, a bastion of shell companies and anonymously purchased real estate. American elites have learned to plant money offshore with acumen that comes close to matching their crooked counterparts’ abroad.</p><p><br></p><p>But, again, I consider something else the worst affront Manafort visited upon our nation. No denying Trailblazing the outer ethical limits of the age old art of influence peddling stands as an impressive accomplishment. Corrupting and perverting the Constitution of The United States may just have been side event, just one more toolbox tactic for Manafort. And, the tenant of the Constitution, is a very difficult one to explain and understand. </p><p>    The trend towards removing the Republic parts of the Constitution with more Democracy parts.  After the 17th amendment in 1913 The Electoral College may have already </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Inevitably Manafort's ambition lead to the most lucrative form of government corruption nay the most financially rewarding to insiders of all government activity in general, the selling of weapons of war. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The head of the Federalist Society. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]></Contents>

    <Summary>No one's opinion changed. Whether one uses the spinal cord fear based brain or the rational cognitive lobes will not change over the course of this one debate. The deep red non-thinking majority registered with neural blasts of ecstatic joy when Cruz blasted illegal immigrants, and genuflected to guns and god. Cruz knows the formula. Beto applied reason with his own brand of passion and sincerity. Beto was nervous but remained articulate. Who won depends on what one wants to hear which depends on where one stands on the issues.  </Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>My favorite line delivered in tonight's debate between Beto O'Rourke / Ted Cruz debate came after the slimy lawyer Ted gave a long winded left handed seeming complement. </p><p>Beto just rolled his eyes and said. "True to form". There was a spontaneous explosion of applause. Some people got it.&nbsp;Kind of an inside joke. </p><p>You have to know to that which he was referring. You have to appreciate scumbag Ted's well known modus operandi So, after Cruz got done with a rambling hate drenched supposed compliment, an old saw; "My opponent is sincere in his beliefs, his radical anti American, out of the main stream ideas." Beto slipped in a three word reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>True to form. </p><p>Bret Stephens in the New York Times on Ted Cruz: He's like a serpent covered in Vaseline. He treats the American people like two-bit suckers in 10 gallon hats. He sucks up to guy who insulted his wife by reteet, no less. Phony piety an even phonier principles. I see him as a cross between Jimmy Swaggart and the shining His ethics are purely situational he makes Trump look like a human being by comparison. Cruz is conniving enough to put one over on you but not perceptive enough to know that you see right through him. He's the type of man who would sell his family into slavery to win an election and then bemoan their slavery as a sob story to get himself reelected.</p><p>Given that visually and physically Cruz exudes such a disgusting demeanor, what explains hi success? How could such a sleazebag get elected to the senate and almost made it to the presidency. The explanation is that he happens to be a very skilled rhetorician. Whenever someone who speaks well waxes eloquent conservative spinal cord, wave the flag, racist xenophobic hot buttons you have to wonder about sincerity. Could Ted Cruz be a sophist?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rhetoric</strong></p><p>the word rhetoric has been given a bad name. Fancy evasive empty talk is dismissed as labeling it rhetoric. Most people today would define rhetoric as "empty meaningless talk". Actually, empty talk is the opposite of rhetoric, or at least not very good rhetoric. Because the traditional definition of the word rhetoric is closer to "The Art of Persuasion" Selling an insurance policy is persuasion, asking someone out on a date, taking a job interview, getting elected to office is the art of persuasion and an exercise is rhetoric. Advocating for your position online, in a business conference room or on the floor of the general assembly the art of persuasion is rhetoric.</p><p>Aristotle wrote a book about it as have many others. Debate clubs practice the art. Appeals to reason and appeals to ethics are considered but all agree logic and morals are never more effective than plays to emotion. </p><p>Recognizing the massive importance of rhetoric in so much of human activity from making a deal to getting a job to convincing your friends which restarunt to go for dinner, I'm sorry to report there may be a dark side to the ancient and respected art of rhetoric.</p><p>  There's a small problem. Sophisticated practitioners have discovered effective ways to manipulate people by inflaming their emotions. Masters of the art of persuasion have a tremendous power.</p><p>Sleazy Ted is good at his own form of ridicule and fear mongering, racially coded, hate drenched word craft that qualifies as rhetoric.      </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>One of the most existentially lasting horrors that will outlast all the sliminess of Ted Cruz is the complete misrepresentation of 2nd amendment, codifying the individual's right to bear arms, which simply not what the Constitution state. Ted argued the Heller case.  </p><p><br></p>]]></Contents>

Then as a partisan warrior former Young Republican finding himself plotting the destruction of Bill Clinton you have to wonder if he ever thought in the back of his mind "I just hope none of the stuff I did ever gets found out." Later in the White House writing torture memos justifying the illegal war precipitated by the Cheney staged false flag operation of 9/11, even in the front of his mind he must have worried "Can you imagine if any of this ever got out?" And when he finally got made a federal judge after a contentious lie filled hearing, and every day since, ever wanting to get on the Supreme Court and inflict his hatred of non elites on as many disadvantaged people and especially non whites, Bret fretted every day, "What if they ever find out about all the stuff we did back in the day?" Maybe he obsessively thought out the details. Now, exactly as he imagined, he worst fears are being realized.</p>]]></Contents>

    <Summary>Relativity is just that; the perspective from a relative position. The theory of Relativity explains nicely how things appear from where we are here and now. And where are we? We are under several layers of atmosphere, inside an electromagnetic field pulsing from the poles, on the surface of a sphere rotating at about one thousand miles per hour, revolving around a star 93 million miles away 67,108 miles per hour. The star we call the sun is itself travels at almost half a million miles per hour within the Milky Way Galaxy.   </Summary>

    <Summary>Mark Judge, the then boy reported by Christine Blasey Ford to be in the room when Brent Kavanaugh assaulted her, has collaborated her story. Mark Judge cops to the story. Mark Judge Breaks Down Under Questioning. Senators have not be allowed to see this report.</Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>The FB-302 interview from the investigation of claims against prospective nominee for the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh cops to the story. This not one submitted in the final report to Congress. That one only contains a statement from some lawyers that says Mr. Judge has no knowledge of because he can't remember any such event. There are actually four 302 interviews conducted on Mark Judge. It is in the fourth one where Mr. Judge breaks and admits that the event occurred.</p><p>Senators have not be allowed to see this report.
</p>

<p>The Investigation May Have Already Succeeded In Bringing Down Kavanaugh Confirmation</p>

<p>Regardless of the sexual assault claims, there are also a lot of other concerns that maybe one or two republicans might considering disqualifying coming from the testimony in the Special Hearing where Cristine was first introduced to the American people. The temperament displayed by the current judge and aspiring justice seemed almost the opposite of what all reasonable standards one would expect from any judge. The temperament displayed was disqualifying for any job interview, for any person, let alone a lifetime appointment.</p>

<p>Then there's the issue of lying. I'll give Bret this much credit, at least he's not a very good liar. They prepped him to be like Trump, or at least take the Trump Line; deny, deny, deny everything. Sawn, his debate coach also told him to fight, fight, fight back; sound indignant, outraged, shocked, shocked that anyone would ever even say anything so demeaning, insulting, and disgusting about a person like me, me who went to Yale. But nobody can be like Trump and pull it off except Trump.</p>

<p>When it comes to this lying issue, there's the tiny problem that he has been proven to have lied to Congress to get his previous nomination.</p>]]></Contents>

    <Summary>Possibly the oldest document in the world, the mineral, emerald, on which it is written is impossible to date. For those who suspect that there may have been antediluvian civilizations more advanced intellectually and perhaps even technologically than we have today. Antediluvian is a biblical term which means "before the flood". A story similar to Noah's, where the world is destroyed by a great flood, appears in hundreds of ancient cultures. Many agree that it may be a reference to the melting of glaciers that covered the earth as recently as 10,000 years ago. Ten thousand years is less that a blink in terms of geologic time. Bi-pedal hominid bones and even footprints have been found that are a million or two or three years old. What could have happened fifty thousand or two hundred thousand years ago? That would still leave two million nine hundred and eighty thousand years still unaccounted for."That which is below is like that which is on high. and that which is on high is like that which is below; by these things are made the miracles of one thing." Was this passed down to us from the eons? Why? And what could it mean?</Summary>
    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>The legend of Thrice Great Hermes Trismegistus, a Greek translation of the Egyptian god of Knowledge Troth, has suffered from the slight detail that essentiallyall of the potentially greatest store of wisdom ever has been lost. Throughout the dark ages, and up until recent times, lots of bogus alchemy and witchcraft, and all manner of weird and crazy stuff has been passed off as "Hermetic Writings". </p><p>Although it may be dozens of hundreds of years old in some cases, it none the less remains thousands of years more recent than any actual ancient wisdom, if indeed there ever was any, except for one tiny scrap The Emerald Tablet seems to have survived, even though it too seems now lost to the public The Emerald Tablet the Tabula Smaragdina, may have survived longer than most all else precisely because it seems it was quite literally carved in stone, on a slab of green desert glass. There is no way to date an inorganic slab of a mineral. it could be very, very old. Most of it is fairly boring animistic esoteric, cosmic comments, which have been expanded on by many. But there is one phrase from the ancient past that fascinates me the most. There are many translations. T</p><p><br></p><p>hat which is below is like that which is on high. and that which is on high is like that which is below; by these things are made the miracles of one thing

 </p><p>1) It is true without untruth, certain and most true<br>2) that which is below is like that which is on high, and that which is on high is like that which is below; by these things are made the miracles of one thing. <br>3) And as all things are, and come from One, by the mediation of One, So all things are born from this unique thing by adaption. <br>4) The Sun is the father and the Moon the mother. <br>5) The wind carries it in its stomach. The earth is its nourisher and its receptacle. <br>6 The Father of all t0he Theleme of the universal world is here. <br>6a) Its force, or power, remains entire, <br>7) if it is converted into earth. <br>7a) You separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, gently with great industry. <br>8) It climbs from the earth and descends from the sky, and receives the force of things superior and things inferior. <br>9) You will have by this way, the glory of the world and all obscurity will flee from you.
1<br>0) It is the power strong with all power, for it will defeat every subtle thing and penetrate every solid thing <br>11a) In this way the world was created.<br>12) From it are born wonderful adaptations, of which the way here is given.<br>13) That is why I have been called Hermes Tristmegistus, having the three parts of the universal philosophy.<br>14) This, that I have called the solar Work, is complete</p><p></p><div><br>Above So Below. By these things all are made one. Many people might focus on this second observation, that there is a oneness beneath all the strife and diversity and difference and uniqueness of physical life here on Earth, and this is a worthy avenue of philosophical investigation, one that especially benefits from the application of mind altering drugs, I might add.  However, it is the often overlooked first statement, Above So Below that most intrigues me, because it supports my Animal House Theory of the Cosmos, that our Solar System is but an atom, our universe but a molecule, and that we exist within the small intestines of some vast organism to which a million years is but a fraction of a second, and under our fingernails exist untold tropical oceans.</div><div> I'm talking about the fractal universe. I'm talking about vibrations. The disturbances, the vibrations that cause the electrons to spin, the photon waves traveling through your consciousness. Atoms are solar systems. The universe is an organism, a fibrous jellyfish floating in a comic ocean. Within a single cell of a leaf on a tree with ten billion extremely similar cells on a tree with millions of similar leaves in a field with thousands of other similar trees. Each cell full of billions of atoms. Each atom containing furiously spinning, rotating and orbiting and racing along. </div><div>Maybe they knew. Back, ages ago, what did As Above So Below mean to those in the ancients? Could they have some conception of their reality that we today refuse to recognize?<br></div><div>  Some speculate that people were more spiritual, more tuned in to the pulses of the Milky Way, more susceptible to the mystical cosmic energy surrounding us than those of us in the practical competitive fast passed material world we live in today. We can't even see the stars at night because of all the artificial ambient light of our electrified computerized, fossil fuel powered twenty four hour drive through flood lit thundering highway existence.  Someday after I'm gone somebody may come back and read these words and shake their head at the ignorance of our vicious conservative eco destructive selfish arrogant times and smile that at least I was aware of the infinity in both directions represented by the words As Above So Below. Unlikely that any of this will exist after even a short power outage but you never know.</div><p></p>]]></Contents>

    <Summary>A cartoon joke president now has an absurd joke supreme court justice. ALL CAPS Hannity now runs the country. Hannity coached Brent how to yell. Thinking people laughed, mocked, did spit takes, marveled. Beyond absurd. You can't make anything up as absurd as the idea of putting anyone with the temperament more completely and perfectly the absolute opposite of the character Hannity convinced his fellow Irish Catholic to portray at his hearing. But it worked. The appointment only proves that screaming with rage about the Clintons still ignights a large enough portion of the electorate. Brent yelled that he takes any attacks on him as personal and that we would all soon reap the whirlwind. But who will reap this whirlwind.

Everything was taking so long my computer was getting so wrapped up in knots. Sometimes to make one little change move one little <dvi> I press F5 time after time. Soon the machine entirely locks up. </p><p>Once, when I used to go to computer developer meeting groups, the great Scott Hanselman was giving the talk. He had just purchased a solid state hard drive. They were brand new back then and very expensive. Scott waxed poetic about the warm feeling of wellbeing and contentment that has overcome him from his new purchase. He loved how his box boots up super fast, "in a flash" if you'll forgive the pun. (A SSD solid state drive is essentially a large flash drive. Add supposedly apps run many time faster. Since then I have totally wanted a solid state hard drive. </p><p>Now, a few years after hearing Scott Hanselman the prices for SSDs have dropped and their size has grown tremendously. Online I found them for around one hundred bucks. Best Buy even had one on special and in stock and within a mile of my house. But it's not enough just to buy this now very small component. You have to install it. And I also want to format it as my boot drive and install my operating system and change my current from a boot drive to a data drive. </p><p>Theoretically I could do all that myself.  Back in the day I'd jump into a project like that without thinking. After all I'm a computer guy, right? But at my age I understand that driving a car, or even being a professional car driver is not the same as replacing the car's transmission.

    <Contents><![CDATA[<p>  Brent has been a partisan warrior for many years. I'm not so worried about abortion. The federal government, the congress, will never pass anti abortion laws. It's not a winning issue; a solid majority of people in most states are opposed to overturning a woman's right to choose. A few states will rush to pass even more elaborate restrictions and they will now make it through any court challenges, but many states will not. Abortion is all about Jesus furor    There are many other issues that differentiate liberals from conservatives. Guns; we already live in a world with near maximalist gun rights.

<img align="left" style="padding:14px" src="http://localhost:40395//App_Data/Images/aYXsEloK330K.jpg"></p><p>now I am working on inserting images in the body here the same way. As this change shows, just getting something to work doesn't mean it can't be improved. Often improvement means simplifying. Occom's Razor states </p><p>Right after you get something to work you're pleased and ready to get on to something else. <span style='display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Helvetica Neue",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'>There are always more changes I want to make. I already have a long list. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]></Contents>
