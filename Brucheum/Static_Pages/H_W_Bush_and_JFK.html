He could have written his own political ticket, yet he went into  publishing. Many expected him to land in politics and most likely were a  bit perplexed when he decided to publish a magazine instead.</strong></p><p><strong>Some thought he was afraid to go into politics because of the ?<a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/secret-societies-illuminati.shtml#Structure" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Kennedy</strong></a>  Curse.? However, nothing could be further from the truth. What he did  proved to be more dangerous than any political arena, and he knew that  from the start. But?John-John had a mission?and that mission was to  expose the villain who orchestrated that ?dastardly act? upon his  father.</strong></p><p><strong>Unbeknownst to the public, John-John was digging deep for  proof. And, how else could he expose the truth when all the media  outlets were controlled by the very cabal he planned to expose?  Enter??George.?</strong></p><p><strong>When he presented his magazine, ?George,? to the world, he was, for all practical purposes, signing his own death warrant.</strong></p><p>?George? was a veiled threat?in a symbolic sort of way. Do you see?  How many men named ?George? comes to mind at just the thought of  President John F. Kennedy?s so called assassination? The cabal wanted  his father dead, that is a fact, but the namesake of John F. Kennedy,  Jr.?s magazine?their minion, arranged it. And?once he had the proof, the  truth would come out in his very own magazine. Do you see?</p><p>?As President, John F. Kennedy understood the predatory nature of  private central banking. He understood why Andrew fought so hard to end  the Second Bank of the United States. So Kennedy wrote and signed  Executive Order 11110 which ordered the US Treasury to issue a new  public currency, the United States Note.</p><p>Kennedy was working with President Soekarno of Indonesia who was at  that time the signatory for the Global Collateral Accounts which were  intended to be used for humanitarian purposes but which were subverted  at the time of the Bretton-Woods agreement at the end of WWII.</p><p>The intention of Kennedy and Soekarno was to end the reign of the  globalist privately owned central banking system ? which is the main  reason that Kennedy was killed, and for his part Soekarno remained under  house arrest for the rest of his life.? From: <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/false-flag-engineered-wars.shtml#BankersWars" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All Wars Are Bankers? Wars</a></strong></p><p>There was a rumor that John-John had obtained the proof he needed and  an expose? was in the works, until his untimely, and mostly  ?suspicious,? death. Of course, the media campaigned that he was an  irresponsible thrill seeker; but then they would, wouldn?t they?  Although many people knew JFK, Jr. was murdered; and they were right  about who was responsible?they were just wrong about the reason.</p><p>John Jr. was warned by family members about the risks involved in his  pursuit. But, he was determined to get justice for his father and bring  truth to light, exposing the darkness that shrouds our planet. So ask  yourself?what would you do, if you were a mere babe when your father,  who just happened to be the most important man in the country, was  murdered in such a gruesome manner, and you never had the opportunity to  know him?would you just let it go?</p><p>Although he was from <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/secret-societies-illuminati-2.shtml#Bloodlines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one of the main Illuminati family bloodlines</a></strong>,  JFK was in fact trying to undo some of the mess ? and to bring an end  to the Reserve Banking System. For his efforts he was assassinated on  November 22, 1963.</p><p><strong>The Bush Connections</strong></p><p>Many researchers and historians have come to the conclusion that it was the <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.rense.com/general76/hunt.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">elite power structure running the US Government</a></strong> that were responsible for the assassination of JFK, and that there was more than one reason for them doing so.</p><p>There are photographs claiming to show that George Bush was at Dealey  Plaza on the day of the killing, and while they might be inconclusive  there are multiple other sources that George Bush was one of those  responsbile for the assassination of JFK and that he was indeed there  that day.

MORE Startling Evidence of Bush in Dallas ? by John Hankey ? <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://thedarklegacy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TheDarkLegacy.com</a></strong></p><p>I don?t think we are much encouraged to see History as science. Quite  the opposite, actually. And of course, that?s all politics. The winners  write history, and the truth be damned. Even science can have trouble  trying to act like science when political issues are involved, as we see  with evolution, tobacco-and-cancer, and global warming.</p><p>But I think History does have a lot in common with physical science.  For example, I can remember when ?Continental Drift?, the idea that  Africa and America were once stuck together, was very much considered  ?just a theory?; ridiculed by some, and regarded with amusement by many,  and promulgated as likely by a tiny minority.</p><p><strong>?Fifty men have run America, and that?s a high figure.?</strong></p><p><strong>? Joseph Kennedy, Father of JFK, in the July 26th, 1936 issue of The New York Times</strong></p><p>But as time goes by, the evidence accumulates; and the meaning of old  evidence begins to settle in; and ideas that were once considered  outrageous gradually get worn in and start to be regarded as obvious  common sense. Part of this process is the continual accumulation of new  evidence.</p><p>New pieces are added to the puzzle and the picture becomes more  clear. And sometimes the hidden meaning of old evidence, that has been  lying around for years, suddenly jumps out.</p><p>Evidence of the fossils and minerals that can be found on the east  coast of Africa, and on the west coast of Brazil, may have been lying  around for years, before someone decided to look and see if they  matched, and found that they did; and proved conclusively that west  Africa and Brazil were once attached.</p><p><strong>Trailer:</strong></p><p>With regard to George HW Bush and the murder of John Kennedy, Joseph McBride found this memo in 1988.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bush-kennedy-connection-1.jpg"></p><p>FBI director J. Edgar Hoover wrote this memo 5 days after the assassination, naming George Bush as a CIA officer.</p><p>The last, and most crucial paragraph, is very hard to read. The following is a transcription:</p><p><strong>?The substance of the forgoing information was orally furnished to <em>Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency</em> and Captain William Edwards of the Defense Intelligence Agency on November 23, 1963, by Mr. V.T. Forsyth of this Bureau.?</strong></p><p>When it was first released in 1978, George Bush was an obscure  bureaucrat, a virtual unknown. So when the best researchers on the  planet saw this memo in 1978, they didn?t pay much attention to it. When  Bush became vice president two years later, no one was able to connect  his now well-known name to this obscure memo.</p><p>But when Joseph McBride was messing around in 1988, Bush was running  for president; and when McBride saw the memo, he jumped up and shouted:</p><p><strong>?Hey, this memo is about Bush! It says he was in the CIA, way back in 1963!?</strong></p><p>And for the longest time, the focus was on this simple isolated fact: <strong>that Hoover said Bush was in the CIA in ?63.</strong></p><p>Bush said the memo must be referring to another ?George Bush,?  because he wasn?t in the CIA at that time. But over the years, people  were able to assemble the facts from Bush?s personal life, showing his  deep involvement with the CIA at that time, and with the CIA?s  anti-Castro Cubans (in the memo, Hoover calls them ?misguided  anti-Castro Cubans?).</p><p><strong>And over time, it has become undeniable; that Hoover was  referring, in his memo, to none other than George Herbert Walker Bush.  And for a while, that was it. End of story.</strong></p><p>But the title of this Hoover memo is, ?Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy?. Isn?t that important?</p><p>Well, you?d think so. But for the longest time, no one made much out  it. Besides, Hoover scarcely mentions the assassination in the memo,  instead focusing on these ?misguided anti-Castro Cubans.? The body of  the memo does not appear, at first, to be in any way related to the  title of the memo ?the assassination of President John F Kennedy?.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/e-howard-hunt-confession.jpg"></p><p>From Rolling Stone Magazine: <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/the-last-confession-of-e-howard-hunt-20070405" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Last Confession of E. Howard Hunt</a></strong></p><p>But then Mark Lane, in his book Rush to Judgment, did the fabulous  work of demonstrating, and in fact persuading a jury, that E. Howard  Hunt, a major lieutenant in the CIA?s ?misguided anti-Castro Cuban?  program, was in Dallas and involved in the assassination.</p><p>With this background, with this framework to guide the researcher, it  was then possible to assemble the considerable evidence linking Bush to  Hunt.</p><p>People might have taken some notice before that Bush made the unusual  request, as Nixon?s ambassador to the UN, to be given an office in the  White House. They may have noticed that Hunt, <strong>although he was  not being paid by anyone in the White House, or answering to anyone that  we know of in the White House, also had a White House office.</strong></p><p>?<strong>The very word ?secrecy? is repugnant in a free and open society;</strong> and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to<strong> secret societies,</strong> to secret oaths and to secret proceedings?</p><p>Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe? <strong>no war ever posed a greater threat to our security.</strong></p><p>If you are awaiting a finding of ?clear and present danger,? then I can only say <strong>that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent?</strong> For <strong>we  are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy  that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of  influence?on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of  elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by  night instead of armies by day</strong>.<strong>I</strong></p><p>t is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources  into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that  combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and  political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its  mistakes are buried, not headlined. <strong>Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.</strong></p><p>No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.?</p><p>? John F Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, from a speech  delivered to the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 27,  1961 and <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://wakeup-world.com/2011/05/20/jfks-speech-on-secret-societies/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">known as the ?Secret Society? speech (click here for full transcript and audio)</a>.</strong></p><p>But with the Hoover memo in hand, establishing Bush as a supervisor  of the CIA?s ?misguided anti-Castro Cuban? operation, it is possible to  connect Bush to Hunt at the Bay of Pigs. With this memo in hand, it is  possible to connect Bush and Hunt as two CIA operatives with offices  inside the White House.</p><p>With this memo in hand, it is possible to answer who it was that Hunt  answered to inside the White House; and how he got the office in the  first place. And with all that, it is possible to connect Bush to Hunt,  and therefore to Dallas, to Hunt in Dallas, and to the ?misguided  anti-Castro Cuban? assassins of John Kennedy.</p><p><strong>An Exclusive You Have To See: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/12/an-exclusive-you-have-to-see-the-last-frontier-of-free-press-is-here-no-more-censorship-unlike-youtube-and-others-3251778.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Last Frontier of Free Press Is Here!

Edgar hoover</p><p>Which is what Hoover did for us when he wrote the title of the memo.  Little by little, the pieces start to fall into place. And pieces that  in isolation meant nothing, become key parts of a whole picture.</p><p>But even so, this is not a rock-solid connection: Hunt was directly involved in the murder of JFK. And Bush supervised Hunt.</p><p>But Bush probably supervised a lot of CIA people, not all of whom  were directly involved in the assassination. A high-ranking officer may  be connected to all of the acts of all of his troops, by reason of his  being their commander. But it?s not a direct connection. It doesn?t  establish that the officer knew about, or approved of, or was involved  in, all the actions of those troops.</p><p><strong>Enter FBI memo # 2:</strong></p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bush-kennedy-connection-2.jpg"></p><p>It will come up again in a minute, so please read the first line  carefully. Bush identifies himself to the FBI as an independent oil man  from Houston.</p><p>This memo establishes that sort of direct connection between Bush and Hunt, in Dallas, on the day of the assassination.</p><p>This memo records Bush?s phone call to the FBI, precisely an hour and  fifteen minutes after the assassination. When I first encountered this  memo, and when I first put it into my movie, JFK II, I simply called it  ?weird?.</p><p>I saw it only in isolation, a weird, isolated connection between Bush  and the assassination. It took me years to see it in context. <strong>That is, to see that this phone call demonstrates, clearly, that George Bush, was on duty that day.</strong></p><p>He was staying at the Dallas Sheraton because his duty assignment was  in Dallas. His phone call to the FBI cannot have been random. This  James Parrott worked for Bush as a sign-painter; he was not an assassin;  this phone call is not what it purports to be; Bush was fulfilling some  obscure under-cover function in making this call.</p><p>So the phone call has to be seen as part of his CIA assignment; which  was clearly connected to the assassination. This memo then establishes  that Bush was in the Dallas area, and on duty; and that his duty  assignment was connected to the assassination. And if his men were in  Dallas shooting the President, as they were, he was certainly on duty  supervising them.</p><p>?The Society [Society of Jesus aka the Jesuits] employs a variety of  ruthless tactics to accomplish its long-term goal (of a New World Order  which pays homage to their Black Pope). One is carrying out political  assassinations of world leaders who refuse to comply with its demands.</p><p>These assassinations in the U.S. have included presidents (Abraham  Lincoln, JFK), cabinet members, congressmen, senators, diplomats,  journalists, scientists and religious and business leaders. ?</p><p>?Assassinations are carried out by the aforementioned intelligence  agencies and their Mafia partners in the drug and gambling trades, often  with collateral assistance from the Knights of Malta, the Freemasons,  the Knights of Columbus, and Propaganda Due (P2). Such was the case in  the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and some former Popes.?</p><p>From: <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/secret-societies-illuminati-1.shtml#Bush" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The History And Mission Of The Nazi-Illuminati Bush (Scher(f)f) Crime Family</a></strong></p><p>If he were not supposed to be supervising them, his bosses would have  assigned him to be at his home office in Houston, Texas; or on his oil  rigs in the Caribbean.</p><p>But, even in context, this memo and the phone call it describes is  still weird, no? I mean, how could Bush have been so stupid as to make  this insanely incriminating phone call? Without this FBI memo, recording  this phone call, we don?t know, or even have a good clue as to where  Bush was, or what he was doing the day of the assassination. Do we?</p><p>Bush has, until recently, simply said that he did not remember what  he was doing the day of the assassination. But with this memo, Bush  tells us where he was and what he was doing ? he hands us his head on a  silver platter.</p><p>What could possibly have motivated him to make such a stupid error as  making this phone call to the FBI? It?s a valid question. It?s not an  essential question. We can still value this memo, and extract a great  deal of important content from it without answering the question of why,  but the question remains.</p><p><img width="400" height="601" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/family-of-secrets-bush.jpg"></p><p>And we can make a stab at answering it. Russ Baker in his fine book,  Family of Secrets suggests that Bush was attempting to establish an  alibi. Now, by making this phone call, he, in fact, establishes that he  was in the Dallas area, and that he was on duty, related to the  assassination.</p><p>So if he?s trying to establish an alibi to cover-up where he actually  was and what he was actually doing, what he is trying to cover up must  be some pretty bad stuff, some pretty incriminating stuff, if it?s worse  than what he gives us with this alibi.</p><p>And what could be worse than what he gives us? Well, obviously, he  must have actually been in Dallas. In fact, I think, this situation  suggests he must have actually been in Dealey Plaza. I mean seriously.  Think about it. He?s so panicked about the truth coming out, that he  puts his head in a noose and hands it to us.</p><p>It makes me think he must have been in Dealey Plaza, he must have  been in the company of the shooters, and he must have felt that there  would be evidence to prove that.</p><p>We?re just speculating at the moment. We?ll get to the evidence right  now, but I?m trying to set the scene. If a guilty party is in a panic,  trying to cover evidence connecting them to a crime, they may invent an  explanation, or an alibi, that seems like a good idea at the time; but  that in fact constitutes a very damaging admission. Anyway, stew on that  while you consider this photo:</p><p><img width="400" height="550" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bush-kennedy-connection-3.jpg"></p><p><strong>An Exclusive You Have To See: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/12/an-exclusive-you-have-to-see-the-last-frontier-of-free-press-is-here-no-more-censorship-unlike-youtube-and-others-3251778.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Last Frontier of Free Press Is Here! No More Censorship, Unlike YouTube and Others!</a></strong></p><p>You see this tall thin man in a suit, with a receding hair line. Many  people claim this is Bush, standing in front of the Texas School Book  Depository. And it might be. It might be a lot of people. And perhaps,  when he called the FBI and incriminated himself, Bush was concerned that  he might show up in a better picture than this, where he was positively  recognizable, looking towards the camera.</p><p>Personally, I don?t think this photo looks much like Bush; and in  fact, I didn?t think he?d be stupid enough to just be hanging around the  murder scene. I thought he was sufficiently high ranking that he?d  leave such on-scene stuff to his underlings. Right?</p><p>At least in my mind, if you?re an officer like Bush, you?re the  coach. You plan, you train and prepare your people, and then you stand  back and watch it happen. Or so I thought. Fletcher Prouty was certain  that he saw pictures of Ed Lansdale, a military operative of the highest  rank, signaling to the ?tramps? arrested behind the grassy knoll to ?be  cool,? that everything was alright.</p><p>Hunt was a high-ranking CIA officer, chief of the CIA?s Mexico  station; and his son says he is one of the ?tramps? who show up in  several photos of men who were arrested behind the grassy knoll. So,  some of the highest ranking members of the killers? operation were  apparently there, on the front line, to make sure that when things went  wrong, as they inevitably do, these high ranking officers could be there  to fix whatever the problem was.</p><p>So, given that high- and low- ranking CIA officers were present, this  photo of this thin man in a suit might, indeed, be Bush. It?s possible.</p><p>And now, look at this picture of the Dal-Tex building. The Dal-Tex  building is across the street from the Book Depository, and many leading  researchers into the assassination, including Jim Garrison, say there  was certainly a team of shooters in this building:</p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bush-kennedy-connection-4.jpg"></p><p><img width="400" height="227" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bush-kennedy-connection-5.jpg"></p><p>And as you can see, some imaginative individual has added some colour  to indicate three men in this window. Very creative, very imaginative;  and at least plausible. Still, it takes way too much imagination and  effort, to see Bush?s face. <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.ratical.com/ratville/JFK/WTKaP.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">But now observe this link</a></strong>.</p><p>Actually, You don?t have to stop and read it, because I?ll quote the  relevant part. It?s a statement from Roger Craig, winner of the deputy  of the year award for Dallas in 1960, and one of the most honest men  working that day in Dallas. He?s an amazing and heroic fellow, worthy of  all the time you could take looking into his background and character.  And here, in the following passage, he is describing a conversation he  had with Jim Garrison, and he says,</p><p><strong>?Jim also asked me about the arrests made in Dealey Plaza  that day. I told him I knew of twelve arrests, one in particular made by  R. E. Vaughn of the Dallas Police Department. The man Vaughn arrested  was coming from the Dal-Tex Building across from the Texas School Book  Depository.</strong></p><p><strong>The only thing which Vaughn knew about him was that he was an  independent oil operator from Houston, Texas. The prisoner was taken  from Vaughn by Dallas Police detectives and that was the last that he  saw or heard of the suspect.?</strong></p><p>Holy Moe Lee! Please notice that, in speaking to Jim Garrison, Craig  says ?in particular?. Apparently he and Vaughn thought this was the most  significant arrest made that day; pretty amazing given that E.Howard  Hunt was arrested in the rail yard behind the grassy knoll. And the only  thing Craig knew about this ?particular? arrestee was that he had  exactly the same singular CIA-cover, <strong><em>?an independent oil operator from Houston, Texas?</em></strong>, that George Bush had used that same day in his contact with the FBI.</p><p>Now. There are a very limited number of possible explanations for who this ?independent oil operator? was. Let?s look at them.</p><p><strong>It is conceivable that the CIA had two men in Dallas area  that day, supervising the shooters, who both had the designated cover of  being an ?independent oil operator from Houston.?</strong> Bush was  one, as the evidence above clearly shows; and perhaps there was another  who was with the shooters in the Dal-Tex building, supervising them  directly.</p><p>But unless the CIA overlords were trying to set Bush up, they would  not have told anyone else to use Bush?s CIA cover to identify themselves  to the police. If another man was involved in the crime, and was  arrested for it, and he told the cops he was an ?independent oil  operator from Houston,? this would tend to throw suspicion in Bush?s  direction.</p><p><strong>?The Khazarian Mafia?s intense hatred of anyone who professed  faith in any God but their god Baal has motivated them to murder kings  and royalty, and make sure they can never rule. They have done the same  with American presidents ? running sophisticated covert operations to  disempower them.</strong></p><p>If that doesn?t work the KM assassinates them, like they did to  McKinley, Lincoln and JFK. The KM wants to eliminate any strong rulers  or elected officials who dare to resist their Babylonian money-magick  power or their covert power gained from their deployment of their human  compromise network.?</p><p><strong>From: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/secret-societies-illuminati-2.shtml#Khazarian-Illuminati" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Hidden History Of The Incredibly Evil Khazarian Mafia [Illuminati Cabal Zionists?]</a></strong></p><p>Bush?s association with the CIA?s Cubans was already widely known.  Fletcher Prouty knew and wrote of it. Fabian Escalante, the head of  Cuban counter intelligence, knew and has written about it. James Files,  who claims very credibly, to have been a driver for the Mafia shooters  in Dallas, has spoken on-camera about it.</p><p>And FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, knew about it and wrote about it in  his memo. So Bush was already a suspect in Hoover?s eyes. The CIA  planners, then, would not have told anyone else, ?in case you get  arrested, tell the cops you?re an independent oil man from Houston?.  Right? They would not have done this, since it would tend to incriminate  Bush, who was already in a highly visible, highly suspicious position.</p><p>Another unlikely possibility is that this ?independent oil operator  from Houston? was just some innocent oil operator, who somehow managed  to attract suspicion, and was arrested. Do you think it?s possible that  another oil man from Houston just happened to be in that corner of  Dealey Plaza?</p><p><img width="400" height="249" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dealey-plaza.jpg"></p><p>Dealey Plaza today</p><p>I hope you think it?s possible. Because, as unlikely as it seems, if  you think it was possible, then certainly Bush would have been  reasonable in thinking that, as he was being arrested, there were other  independent oil operators in the crowd who witnessed his arrest.</p><p>You see, Bush spoke to a group of oil men in Dallas the night before  the assassination. If it were possible that some of them were in Dealey  Plaza, he would need to be terrified of the possibility that some of  them might actually have seen the arrest, and would have been able to  identify him as the object of that arrest.</p><p>No wonder, then, that Bush freaked out, and made this stupid  incriminating phone call to the FBI. Even if it showed that he was not  in Houston, or in the Caribbean, but in Dallas, at least it suggested  that he was not in police custody for the murder of the President, in  Dealey Plaza.</p><p>But now stop and think a minute: Why was he arrested? What was he  doing that drew this cop?s attention at all? What could he possibly have  been doing to make this cop think that he needed to arrest Bush?</p><p>Perhaps walking out of a building without attracting attention is  harder than it sounds; and it reasonable to suppose that the crowd  outside the Dal-Tex building had heard the shots, had heard that the  President had been wounded, and they were carefully scrutinizing anyone  who came out of the building.</p><p>But this story shows clearly that Bush was not the sort of  cold-blooded killer who could take part in the murder of a man, and then  act and look like nothing was going on as he tried to leave the scene  of the crime. And it turns out that as an old man, Bush continues to  suffer from this character trait, of being unable to hide feelings that  need to be kept secret.</p><p>As you can see below, at Gerry Ford?s funeral, Bush suddenly breaks  into a wide grin while speaking of the Kennedy assassination. This is  not a Mona Lisa smile. This is face-wrenching spasm of glee.</p><p>In a minute we?ll take up the question of why Bush would grin at his  recollection of watching John Kennedy?s brains splatter; the point for  us now is that he apparently had a similarly inappropriate,  show-stopping expression on his face as he attempted to exit the Dal-Tex  building; he had the look of a murderer in his eye, so clearly that it  could not be missed; as this funereal-grin could not be missed.</p><p>And the guilt plastered all over Bush?s face drew people?s attention. And this cop, Vaughn, arrested him.</p><p>Now remember, Roger Craig tells this story in the context of his discussions with New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison<strong> about  the suspects who were arrested that day and who then evaporated without  leaving a mugshot, interview, fingerprint, or name.</strong> Garrison spoke not only to Roger Craig, but he no-doubt spoke to Vaughn, who made the arrest. And Garrison adds the following:</p><p><strong>?At least one man arrested immediately after the shooting had  come running out of the Dal-Tex Building and offered no explanation for  his presence there. Local authorities hardly could avoid arresting him  because of the clamor of the onlookers.</strong></p><p>He was taken to the Sheriff?s office, where he was held for  questioning. However, the Sheriff?s office made no record of the  questions asked this suspect, if any were asked; nor did it have a  record of his name. Later two uniformed police officers escorted him out  of the building to the jeers of the waiting crowd.</p><p>They put him in a police car, and he was driven away. Apparently this  was his farewell to Dallas, for he simply disappeared forever.?</p><p>? On the Trail of the Assassins, p. 238</p><p>This vision of the panicked Bush being arrested, no-doubt terrified  as he was taken to the police station, and possibly even booked (though  the record of any such booking has been destroyed) provides a context  that explains a number of Bush?s otherwise-mysterious actions. Certainly  Bush was freaked out and panic-stricken! An angry crowd clamored for  his arrest, and jeered his release.</p><p>Being a newbie in these dark affairs, Bush didn?t have confidence in  the ability of the old devils at CIA to make water run uphill, to make  time run backwards, to silence the witnesses, to destroy the records,  and make it all go away. And so he panicked; he acted on his own,  stupidly; he called the FBI, thinking that he was ?cleverly? providing  evidence that it wasn?t him who was arrested in front of the Dal-Tex  building that day.</p><p><strong>In his panic-stricken state, this seemed like a good idea. He  was unable to see that he was actually creating a permanent  absolutely-positive record of his involvement.</strong></p><p>We can now also explain the grin. He grins ridiculously at Gerry  Ford?s funeral, at the mention of John Kennedy?s murder, not because he  is such a ghoul that he thinks splattering the contents of Kenney?s head  all over Jackie Kennedy was funny; but because mentioning the  assassination causes him to recall the comedy of errors that produced  his own ridiculous panic, arrest, more panic, and so on.</p><p>Garrison wrote his paragraph about Bush?s arrest in 1988. Deputy  Craig?s article was written in 1971 and posted in 1992. But the  significance of these paragraphs was discovered last week. There hardly  was an internet in 1992 when Craig?s article was posted. And for 19  years, no one noticed that this phrase, <strong>?independent oil man from Houston?</strong>, is a very unique description of Bush.</p><p>No one noticed until last month, when one of the moderators of <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://jfkmurdersolved.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JFKMurderSolved</a></strong> showed it to me. And I wrote about it to some friends, and one of them suggested I read what Jim Garrison had to say.</p><p>So the pieces continue to fall into place. Little by little, the  picture is filled in, the questions get answered. And the conclusions  become more incontrovertible. This is just the sort thing that happened  with the theory of Evolution and the Big Bang theory; and the theory of  continental drift [all three of which are actually bunkum].</p><p>And someday they may start to teach history, as a science, based on evidence, in the universities. Really! It could happen!</p><p>At which point, Bush?s involvement in JFK?s murder will be taught,  like evolution, as the only plausible explanation of the available  reliable evidence.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/JFK-collateral-accounts-soekarno.jpg"></p><p><strong>An Exclusive You Have To See: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/12/an-exclusive-you-have-to-see-the-last-frontier-of-free-press-is-here-no-more-censorship-unlike-youtube-and-others-3251778.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Last Frontier of Free Press Is Here! No More Censorship, Unlike YouTube and Others!</a></strong></p><p>Final note: Until recently, Bush had nothing more to say about his  whereabouts the day of the assassination than that he doesn?t remember  where he was. <strong>That in itself is extraordinarily incriminating.</strong></p><p>Everyone who was alive at the time remembers where they were on 9-11,  and on the day Kennedy was murdered. But, saying that he doesn?t  remember, however improbable, is at least consistent with Bush?s  autobiography, <strong>which mentions nothing.</strong></p><p>Lately, however, perhaps at least partly in response to my work, Bush  and Co. have concocted a story that he was speaking in Tyler, Texas to  the Rotary Club. The vice-president of the Rotary Club, Aubrey Irby,  says that Bush was speaking when the bellhop came over and told him,  that Kennedy was dead [Kitty Kelley, The Family: the Real Story of the  Bush Dynasty, p.213; cited by Russ Baker in Family of Secrets, p.54].</p><p><img width="400" height="338" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-reral-story-of-the-bush-dynasty.jpg"></p><p>Mr. Irby passed the information on to Mr. Wendell Cherry, who passed  it on to Bush; who stopped his speech. Irby says that Bush explained  that he thought a political speech, under the circumstances, was  inappropriate; and then he sat down. As a would-be alibi proving Bush?s  innocence, there are at least three huge problems with this story.</p><p>The first is that it is inconceivable that Bush would not have  remembered such an event; or that he would have left it out of his  autobiography, since it shows what a fine and respectful fellow he is.  If he didn?t remember it sooner, or include it in his autobiography,  it?s clearly because it never happened.</p><p><img width="400" height="206" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/JFK-murder-george-bush-1.jpg"></p><p>The second huge problem with this story is that it couldn?t possibly  have happened; that is, it is made impossible by Bush?s original alibi,  his phone call to the FBI, as you?ll see:</p><p><strong>The witness who tells this story, Aubrey Irby, says that Bush  excused himself and sat down. It doesn?t say that he rushed out of the  room in a frantic search for a phone.</strong></p><p>The problem is that Walter Cronkite?s announcement to the world that Kennedy was dead came at 1:38 PM.</p><p>Certainly, no one was listening to Walter Cronkite in the same room  in which Bush was speaking. Therefore we can be sure that this bellhop,  who told Irby that Kennedy was dead, was in another room. The bellhop  had to make the decision that he had heard enough of the news to leave  off listening to the news.</p><p>This is no small point. Texas governor Connally was severely wounded.  Lyndon Johnson was reportedly wounded. There was much other news to be  confirmed. At some point, then, the bellhop decided to stop listening  and go make an announcement. <strong>There?s no reason to think Irby would be the first person he would tell.</strong></p><p>But at some point he went to the room where Bush was speaking and  informed Mr. Irby that the president was dead. This walk to find Irby  took time, of course. Mr. Irby had to receive the information, and then  he had to decide to inform Mr. Wendell Cherry, the president of the  Kiwanis.</p><p>Mr. Cherry had to decide that he should interrupt Bush?s speech; Mr. Cherry had to then walk over to Bush and tell him the news.</p><p>Bush had to decide what to say; and he had to say it. And, according  to the only witness, Mr. Irby, Bush ?then sat down?. Somehow, when he  was finished sitting, without attracting Mr. Irby?s attention, Bush had  to seek and find a phone. This would have been a hotel phone, so he  would likely have had to go through the hotel switchboard to get an  outside line.</p><p><strong>Do you suppose the switchboard was busy after the announcement of the President?s death?</strong>  It?s a good guess. In Washington D.C. so many people rushed to make a  phone call that the phone system went down. In any case, once he got  through to the hotel operator and got an outside line, Bush then had to  call information and get the number of the FBI.</p><p>After getting through to information, and getting the number, he then  had to call the FBI; and penetrate their switchboard, which was, no  doubt, very busy; and he had to locate an agent, on what must have been  the busiest day in the history of the Dallas bureau.</p><p>How many minutes do you suppose that would take? Twenty seems a fair  guess, though it seems implausible that a civilian could even get  through, given all the official police business going on at the time.</p><p>We know that the Dallas FBI was all over the murder scene,  confiscating camera film and intimidating witnesses; so it?s hard to  imagine how Bush, an hour after the shooting, was able to reach an agent  at all. Given the ?sitting? that Mr. Irby observed Bush doing, for all  this to have transpired in 45 minutes would be tidy work.</p><p><strong>But Bush had to do all of this, as the FBI memo states, by  1:45, seven minutes after the news of Kennedy?s death first went out;  which is blatantly impossible.</strong></p><p>The third problem is this question of why Bush would feel that it was  necessary to concoct such a story at all? Why does he have to tell us  this lie? Why does he have to get others, like Irby, to lie for him? The  irony is that the harder he tries to make himself appear innocent, by  lying, the more evidence he gives us of his guilt.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bush-kennedy-connection-6.jpg"></p><p>There are some people who manage to point to this and say ?ahah!  That?s why Bush was in Dallas! Not to kill the President, but to speak  to the other oilmen!? But as the Hoover memo shows, being an oilman was  just a cover for Bush?s real occupation as a CIA supervisor of trained  killers. <strong>He needed an excuse for being in Dallas. This speaking engagement provided him with one.</strong></p><p><strong>From the Director of Dark Legaqcy: John Hankey</strong></p><p>George Bush killed Kennedy. Or was it the Mafia? Maybe Castro did it.  Who cares? It was 40 years ago. What difference does it make?</p><p>It matters.</p><p>The day he died we lost an invaluable treasure. This video documents  that we lost a man of peace, who tried to cool off the cold war, and to  get the American people to see their Russian enemies, not as despicable  inhuman monsters, but as people like us.</p><p>On November 22, 1963, you lost the man who saved your life on October  17, 1962. At the height of the missile crisis, Kennedy?s generals and  advisors were urging him to launch a first strike attack against Cuba.</p><p><img width="400" height="111" alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cuban-missile-crisis.jpg"></p><p>They assured Kennedy that the Russian missiles in Cuba were not  nuclear and were not ready; but that he and they should quietly slip  away to the safety of bomb shelters anyway, just to be safe; and then  launch an attack, leaving the rest of us out to die. Kennedy thought  about it. And then he told them that nobody was going anywhere.</p><p>If anyone died, they would be the first to go, sitting as they were  in the Whitehouse, the prime target of those Russian missiles. Together  they then figured out a safer plan. Robert McNamara, Secretary of  Defense at the time, recently learned from the Russians that the  missiles were armed, were ready, were nuclear, and that their commanders  were authorized to use them in case of an attack.</p><p>If you live in the northern hemisphere, the lives of your parents,  and your future, were certainly saved by John Kennedy on that day. It  matters that his killers be exposed.</p><p>In his farewell address, President Eisenhower had warned Kennedy, and  the rest of us, of the threat posed to democracy by what Eisenhower  called ?the military industrial complex.?</p><p>And while Kennedy famously went after the CIA, and refused to commit  troops to Vietnam, I always wondered why he didn?t more openly attack  this military industrial complex. And then I stumbled upon a speech he  gave at the United Nations.</p><p>As you will see in the video, he called upon the Russians, and United  Nations, to help him to take on this military industrial complex, in  order to ?abolish all armies and all weapons.? But he was swept away.</p><p>And in the years since, millions have died in needless wars,  trillions of dollars have been wasted on ?defense?, and millions more  people have lived and died needlessly in poverty. <strong>It matters that we lost him.</strong></p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bruce-willis.jpg"></p><p>In 2007, Bruce Willis told Vanity Fair magazine;</p><p><strong>?They still haven?t caught the guy that killed Kennedy. I?ll  get killed for saying this, but I?m pretty sure those guys are still in  power, in some form. The entire government of the United States was  co-opted.?</strong></p><p>Now Willis probably would not mind my suggesting that he?s no genius.  At best, his observation is common sense. 80% of the American people  agree with him. Indeed, this video, proving that Kennedy was brought  down by the most powerful men in the world and their hired thugs, is not  based on secret documents.</p><p>It is all information that has merely been suppressed. Oswald  allegedly shot Kennedy from behind. But the day he died, the NY Times  carried the story, told by the doctors in Dallas, that Kennedy had an  entrance wound in his throat, another in his right temple, and a large  gaping exit wound in the back of his head.</p><p>After talking to the emergency room doctors, Kennedy?s press  secretary described, to the assembled press, a shot to the right temple  from the right front that went ?right through the head.?</p><p>All of the witnesses near the right front, the grassy knoll,  described hearing shots from that direction, and dozens of witnesses  raced up the knoll in pursuit of the shooters. <strong>These witnesses talked to the press. But all of this information has been suppressed for the last 50 years. By whom? Who could?</strong></p><p>You will also see in this video the overwhelming best evidence, from  the best witnesses, proving beyond a reasonable dispute, that Kennedy?s  body was stolen from Air Force One, and the wound to his right temple  was mutilated, before the autopsy.</p><p>Jackie Kennedy kept watch over an empty casket on the flight from  Dallas to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Then the body was quietly taken to  Bethesda for the autopsy, arriving 20 minutes before Jackie and the  empty casket. Who had the power to arrange this?</p><p><img alt="" src="http://tapnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jackie-kennedy-onassis.jpg"></p><p>Who HAS the power today to suppress all this evidence?, and to  continue to bombard us with ridiculous lies about a lone gunman? It?s a  short list, isn?t it? It doesn?t include the mafia, or the Russians, or  Castro. It does include the Bush family ? or rather their masters in Big  Oil; the banking elite; the backbone of the military industrial  complex. These men, and their successors, carried out the attacks of  9-11.

A few months later, Kennedy denied the plan?s author, General  Lyman Lemnitzer, a second term as the nation?s highest ranking military  officer.</p><p>In November of 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.</p><p><strong>About the Film: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://thedarklegacy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dark Legacy</a></strong></p><p>Relying exclusively on government documents, statements from the best  witnesses available, and the words from the mouths of the killers  themselves, Dark Legacy produces a thoroughly substantiated criminal  indictment of George Herbert Walker Bush, establishing beyond a  reasonable doubt his guilt as a CIA supervisor in the conspiracy to  assassinate John F. Kennedy. If we could present this evidence to a jury  in Texas, he would pay with his life.</p><p>***********</p><p>Part one presents the overwhelming mountain of evidence that  President Kennedy was hit by bullets from the front and rear. Every  witness in the Dallas emergency room attests, on camera, to the fact  that a bullet from the right front blew a fist-sized whole in the back  of the President?s head. The New York Times carried these statements on  the day of the murder; and has covered them up ever since.</p><p>*************</p><p>Part two presents the on-camera testimony of the witnesses who  actually handled the President?s body, the FBI report, and the  photographic evidence all proving unequivocally that the President?s  body was stolen from the Secret Service and the wounds altered, before  the body was delivered to Bethesda Naval hospital for the autopsy.  Jackie Kennedy accompanied an empty casket on the plane flight home. Who  had the power to do all this without attracting public attention? It?s a  short list.</p><p>************</p><p>Part three presents the Nazi-connections of the Bush family, which  prompted the FBI to seize their assets during WW II, as Nazi assets. It  presents the suppressed fact that Watergate burglar and CIA operative E.  Howard Hunt was found by a jury to have been in Dallas and involved in  the conspiracy to kill Kennedy.</p><p>Hunt was a supervisor of the misguided CIA-led anti-Castro Cubans who  broke into the Watergate. He is not only connected to Bush through  Watergate; and through Bush?s father, Prescott; but five days after the  assassination, the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, wrote a memo,  titled ?Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy? in which he  named ?George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency? as the supervisor  of what Hoover himself called the ?misguided anti-Castro Cuban? killers  of the President. Bush has said he doesn?t remember the events of that  day, but FBI documents place him in Dallas.</p><p>It is difficult to assess the stature and significance of someone who  has been dead as long as John Kennedy. His killers have also been his  detractors, actively desecrating his memory, as they did his body. The  movie begins with a short presentation of some of his most powerful and  important speeches; including a stunning speech to the UN in which  Kennedy calls for the complete abolition of the military industrial  complex. These same men the military industrial complex, ripped him from  us, and the darkest features of our history since that time are all  directly the result of his murder.</p><p>What will happen when the American people, and those of other Western  nations, emerge from their cocoon of denial and face the reality that  their rulers are among the worst criminals in human history?</p><p>Will the people follow their leaders? example and lapse into lawless,  psychopathic behavior? Will Western leaders ?flee forward? by launching  wars designed to conceal the bloody tracks linking them to past  misdeeds? Or will the pathocracy be overthrown and replaced by something  more humane?</p><p>On such questions hinges the future of humanity. Given the high  stakes, you would have to be crazy not to help spread the truth, change  the system, and save the planet.</p><p>From: <strong><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/r2/?url=http://www.wakeupkiwi.com/news-articles-12.shtml#ConspiracyTheories" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Conspiracy Theories: Scavenging For Truth</a></strong></p><p><strong>Further Information:</strong></p><p>Evidence of Revision is a 9 hour long documentary series whose  purpose is to present the publicly unavailable and even suppressed  historical audio, video, and film recordings largely unseen by the  American public relating to the assassination of the Kennedy brothers.</p><p>It also details t he little known classified Black Ops actually used  to intentionally create the massive war in Viet Nam, the CIA ?mind  control? programs and their involvement in the RFK assassination and the  Jonestown massacre and other important truths of our post-modern time.</p><p><strong>An Exclusive You Have To See: <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/12/an-exclusive-you-have-to-see-the-last-frontier-of-free-press-is-here-no-more-censorship-unlike-youtube-and-others-3251778.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Last Frontier of Free Press Is Here!
