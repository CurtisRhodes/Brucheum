<div>2018 has been a crazy year. Fox News has taken over our nation. That guy at the end of the bar spouting conspiracy theories in currently the president. Here in Texas all the people living on my street, all the people who I would deal with if I were a more socially active community member are still fine with that. The years of indoctrination from radio talkers and their perverse alliance with the Sunday preachers of Christian dogma have paved the way for this&nbsp;</div>

<div>The nominee for United States Ambassador to the United Nations is a leggy blonde Fox News bimbo. Are we living in an elaborate comedy? As too often is said you can't make up stuff like this. If you were to write this book no one would ever think that real life could ever be so absurd. Yet when I see the latest outrage of the day I no longer bother consider my own opinion. When the latest instance of outright criminal lawlessness is reported, when every day something that would take down a democratic politician on its own, thinking liberals need not measure their personal outrage. All that matters is what the congregation at the local Baptist church feel. In my case there are six or seven Baptist churches within a mile and a half of my house. Needless to say if Hillary or Barak did any one of the things reported on a daily basis about the current occupant of the White House these morally pompous church going citizens would be marching in the streets bellowing their outrage at the top of their lungs.&nbsp;<br>Watching Fox News is to almost satisfying seeing these hypocritical idiots have to digest the latest affront to the common norms of decency, criminal and immoral behavior that in another day would be the bread and butter of their news cycle coverage and be forced to accept it as wonderful while running yet story about Hillary's emails. Even if their president gets indicted and thrown in jail there is no indication they would ever abandon him. Can it all be explained in terms of racial and ethnic hatred? Unfortunately, yes. And the United States has no monopoly on these emotions. But when you boil it down to raw primal racial and ethnic hatred there is one other word that usually has to be included: religion.<br><br>The thing about believing in a religion that promises full body resurrection and a judgment system that sends nonbelievers to Hell and a virgin birth and angels and demons is that you can't think about it too hard. If you subject your pre electric light, pre indoor plumbing religious theology to even the slightest glance of critical analysis much of it melts away into quaint superstitious fairy tales. This has to be deeply troubling for true believers. Sincere Christians have to live in a world full of well proven scientific reality while at the same time embracing a literal reading of their gospel. That is why conservatives hate intellectuals so. And hate is too small a word. Conservatives deeply vehemently passionately despise those they see as a threat to their Sunday school stories. Conservatives have to operate in a perceptual frame that accepts superficially that the earth travels around the sun but compartmentalize things in such a way as to still preserve the bible stories they were told as children. They need a leader who when they look at him they see a person who may live in the real world but still seems intellectually thick enough to buy into their spiritual view of life.<br><br>Conservatives knew that W wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed but that's precisely why they loved him. They could tell now this is a guy who can buy the Jesus story hook and line. With their current darling I don't know. Maybe they see that he's a compulsive liar a philanderer a con man and a cheap cheating pompous moron, but that anyone that obtuse must surly be able to believe in things as phantasmagorical as their Jesus stories. Maybe the level of logical rejection needed to accept their exclusive "We're right and everybody else is sinfully wrong" view of the world accommodates a "Build The Wall" us against them mentality more thoroughly than any of us like to admit.&nbsp;<br><br>Trump is such a wholly awful human being there's always a chance that someday they may finally turn against him. I don't see that happening in 2019. When religious people dig into a certain way of thinking any challenge to their position usually only causes them to dig in deeper. The normal reaction by the majority to be appalled by the disgusting behavior of our petulant asshole of a president only deepens their attitude that if the despised intellectual elite disapprove of him so then he must be right. To admit Trump could do anything wrong at this point amounts to a total rejection of their entire belief system. Complaining about him only strengthens him. I see no happy solution. Happy New Year.<br><br></div>
