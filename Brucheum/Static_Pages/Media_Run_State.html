            <div class='summaryText'><p>I been making this point since the days of the Tea Party. I wrote this piece for my new website before the current government shutdown fiasco. Frump had already agreed to a budget approved by a unanimous voice vote and the Senators all left for home. My central point is that talk radio hosts have a different job than actual legislators. Hate radio talkers make their living by keeping listeners engaged for three hours a day every. The most successful ones do it by keeping their outrage level dialed up to max hour after hour day after day screaming and frothing over some outrage or an other. But radio talkers don't have to worry about the consequences of their actions.&nbsp; There should be some way to make them accountable.<br></p></div>
            <div class='articleContent'><div style="font-size:20px; font-family:serif; ">
  The thing about filling three hours a day spewing hate from a radio broadcast booth: It's not the same as actually governing.
  There's no shortage of barstool pontificators who can pontificate about the government for hours on end. It does take a certain type of skill or maybe just a really horrible temperament to remain so outraged for such long periods of time. There are plenty of things that make me angry. When I drop something or think about mistakes, the urge is to blurt out expletive and kick somethings. the urge. Or maybe just angry or if you grow more mellow you just take a deep breath. Maybe you could use a drink. So imagine taking in anger and hate mainlining it at full volume. Is that an enjoyable experience? How about listening to hard core heavy angry music in the background? "I love you for the way you lie to me." some rocker just screamed out. <br>
  
  How about when you drop a&nbsp; glass full of red wine on your white carpet something really worth an expletive is that what you want to feel all day long. What if you listen to the news and building a wall is a real life thing a life and death thing. Is it a comedy? Are they serious? Does anyone else see this ?
 
  <h2>Hate Porn</h2>
If the Metro Section of the newspaper printed pictures of graphic car crashes circulation could increase. If the tv news played videos of people getting shot they might become the most viewed site in the city. But many sites don't do it . Public norms of decency. its called pornography. It's out there it's available now more than ever but it's always been out there and it all depends on what you call it. It's that which is bad. Smoking, taking drugs. How about lying? "Who Do You Trust". Honest outrage is one thing, outrage in general outrage itself includes &nbsp; or getting fat or being mean&nbsp; decency.pacing: normal; line-height: 33px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;
  
  <h2>The product is hate.</h2> Some people like love stories, some people can listen to people talk about sports for hours. Plenty like to hear how their love of Jesus makes them better than everybody else.&nbsp;<br></div><div style="font-size:20px; font-family:serif; ">Some cut straight to the conflict and violence clocked in sports and religion an mainline pure hate. I call it pornography because it's a form socially questionable titillation.&nbsp; Rupert Murdoch learned that he could get away with showing a little T&amp;A on page three circulation would double. Sometimes I wonder if he understood the same thing when it came to peddling vile right wing hate. Stories about welfare queens wagging their finger chanting "Yous Owes It To Me." works just as well as flashing some skin.

Hate talk is a form of pornography and people can get addicted to it. Rush knows how to raise the hairs on the back of his loyal listeners neck get them frothing and I there must be some sort of chemical rush that keeps weak minds coming back for more. &nbsp;</p><b></b><i></i><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><strike></strike><br></div><div style="font-size:20px; font-family:serif; "><b></b><i></i><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><strike></strike><br></div><div style="font-size:20px; font-family:serif; ">Now professional psy-ops operators have weaponized the same tactics. But the hate radio talkers have known all the tricks for a long time. Nobody knows conservatives.
  We now have an absurd joke president who obtained his moral value system from Playboy magazine. Worse, he has become completely indoctrinated by hate radio. Imagine being the one person with access to all the highest level intelligence in the world and yet still prefer believin learned now has an supreme court justice. Rush and Hannity now runs the country. Hannity coached Brent how to yell. Thinking people laughed, mocked, did spit takes, marveled. Beyond absurd. You can't make anything up as counter intuitive&nbsp; idea of putting anyone with the temperament more completely and perfectly the absolute opposite of the character of a sober judge. Hannity convinced his fellow Irish Catholic to portray at his hearing. But it worked. The appointment only proves that screaming with rage about the Clintons still ignites a large enough portion of the electorate. After you have just toiled to create a wonderful literary creation is not the time when you want to see an error. This "unterminated string error' exemplifies the kind of bug that costs hours and days of unnecessarily wasteful and unbearably annoying time.

  Brent has been a partisan warrior for many years. I'm not so worried about abortion. The federal government, the congress, will never pass anti abortion laws. It's not a winning issue; a solid majority of people in most states are opposed to overturning a woman's right to choose. A few states will rush to pass even more elaborate restrictions and they will now make it through any court challenges, but many states will not. Abortion is all about Jesus furor    There are many other issues that differentiate liberals from conservatives. Guns; we already live in a world with near maximalist gun rights. If any gun control laws <p></p></div></div>
