            <div class='summaryText'>Relationships make the world go around. Relationships make life worth living. But relationships can be dangerous. Trusting others opens one to getting taken scammed.Be dependent on another puts one in a powerless position. To give your heart risks getting it broken. Relationships lay at heart of computer programming as well.  A computer program has to provide a specific solution to some specialized domain be of any value. On a structural level a computer programmer has to make use of tools and existing platforms at all levels. There are interesting principles of computer programming that address the centrality of managing relationships. "Don't talk to strangers", the law of Demeter, is actually a term in computer programming. Loosely coupled coarsely grained is a thing. Dependency injection. Wouldn't that be nice? </div>
            <div class='articleContent'><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"> They say that in some programming languages you can write a complete program that outputs "Hello World" in one line of code. This may not be entirely true. To output the characters "Hello World" on screen requires a library of graphics code that manipulates pixels to form letter shaped glyphs and paint those characters on the screen, requires more than one line of code. Then you need a library of code to handle keyboard input. Oh, and you need an operating system to process the key presses and the pixel painting. And you probably could use an editor integrated with a compiler and some debugging tools. All told your one line "Hello World" app actually takes many thousands of lines of code, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of lines of code. And all but one line of that code is written by others. Your app has to establish relationships with all this external code, and, unfortunately, it needs to be said, your app is dependent on all this code working properly. </p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">We all like to think we are independent.  We certainly never want to admit we are dependent on anyone else. As teenagers we rebel against our parents, come to resent them for all they do for us, and struggle to leave the nest and set out on our own. But freedom's just another word for having no one in your life that matters, no one you can count on for help, no one who you have to care for. Maybe freedom isn't all that its cracked up to by libertarians.</p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">Dependencies happen. Dependencies are like the weather. Sometimes you have to put on a coat. But if you are careful and deliberate and aware of the relationships you establish, there are ways to take better control of the situation. </p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">Inside your program, you have much more control over relationships. Let's say you have a written a process called "Clean the Laboratory".  Within this process you have created a function called "Put The Cap on the Bottle".  Now let's say that you write another module in your app called "Launch A Rocket into Space". Remarkably this module also requires a function that puts a cap on the bottle. What do you do?  You could set a reference to your "Clean the Laboratory" process and call the already perfected bottle capping routine. This is the preferred design pattern according to the DRY principle. (Don't Repeat yourself).</p><p style="font-family: sarif; font-size: 18px;">Use the well known programming strategy called "cut and paste" and add the bottle capping functionality inside the Launch Rocket code you violate the Department of Redundancy Department prime directive DRY rule, but, it has its advantages. Establishing a relationship between two largely unrelated code bodies just to share one block of code presents its own problems. It may incur expensive performance costs in terms of loading and unloading large chunks of code into memory and then not disposing of them quickly. And there are other problems establishing this relationship might introduce. If both processes happen to have a variable named "Counter" that isn't properly scoped, even if they have nothing to do with each other they could end up stepping all over each other's memory address locations and inadvertently send the rocket ship hurling into the sea. I hate it when that happens. We will talk about scoping and access modifiers in a later article.</p><p style="font-family: sarif; font-size: 18px;">So the avoidance of setting a relationship in   The problem with cutting and pasting the same block of code all over the place should be obvious. Say you place the "Set The Cancel Button" function on every page of your web site. then you decide to change the image or modify the functionality globally. You are going to have to go touch every page. </p><p style="font-family: sarif; font-size: 18px;">The advantage is if you specialized behavior just on certain pages or a single page you have a place to add that custom functionality.</p><div><br></div><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"> Adding a reference to use just this one block of code requires establishing a relationship between these two essentially totally unrelated bodies of code. This may be expensive in terms of loading and unloading into memory larges blocks of mostly unneeded code. There are other dangers as well. If both process happen to have a variable named "counter", although they have nothing to do with each other they may end on stepping all over each other and <br></p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"><br></p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"><br></p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">  </p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"> </p><p style="font-family: sarif; font-size: 18px;">Say you have a process called .That process is in a module called . Now say you have another module called "Paint the Hallway" It too needs to call the process "Put The Cap on the Bottle". So do you write or cut and paste the cap Bottle function into the paint Hallway class, but that would be a <br></p><div><span style="font-family: sarif; font-size: 18px;">Now let's say that </span><br></div><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"><br></p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">don't like to think we are dependent on someone else, but that's just not the way it is. There's not a lot you can do outside of the realm of your own app. There are settings and configurations that can be set but that's outside the scope of this article. It's like the weather; lot's of people talk about it but all you can do about it is react. It's like the government, you can try but you have to comply. </p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">Inside your program, like inside your own life, if you're careful and deliberate and aware you can take some control ofyour relationships. Who do you trust? Do you want to rely on some shady character who runs a business from behind the local 7-11? But getting rid of a buggy, unreliable component is easy.<br></p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px"><br></p><p style="font-family:sarif;font-size:18px">bad thing. Why? First it isredundant.Don't do it More than once. Redundant is bad, BUT the real problemis that if you find a bug you have to go to more than one place to fix it. Andif you have copiesof the routine five or six places you need to go and tweakall of them. Bad bad bad becuause you know you're going to miss something inone of them. Thus inconsistenciesate introduced.We go into this morewhen we talk about the DRY the don't repeat yourself commandment. So lets getback to the logical and seeming easier solution which is simply just make acall to the already perfect function in the cleanKitchen class. Great, but whatyou have done now by pulling in that reference is load the entire "Cleanthe Kitchen" project just to use one minor function.When we grow up weusually go through a phase where we need to break away from our parents and setout on our own. Some don't have a stable home to break away from, but eventhose who grow up in most ideal homes it's natural for children to feel theneed break away. If that instinct to move out of the nest didn't exist ourspecies might not survive.</p></div>
