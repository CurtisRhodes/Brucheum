Back in the day I used to try to keep it hidden. One day I just threw it all away but not before there were times when my kids visiting their divorced father could have found it. I think I still have a storage box full of vintage porn magazines somewhere up in the attic. Now I have an entire hard drive of naked ladies and on their knees. Now there's no longer any need to even down load anything, just save a bunch of links. Then again there is no much new even free live material out there who needs to even bookmark favorite links let alone have a safe, but I digress. All of us have a pecker safe.<br></div> </div>                        </div>
            <div class='articleContent'><p style="font-family:serif; font-size:18px;">I grew up in New Jersey. The Donald got less than ten percent of the vote in the New York metro area. We'd seen his act for a long time.  Everyone knew he was a con artist, a bore, a deadbeat a cheat and a liar.Even Bible thumping conservatives knew about the pussy grabbing. Now the Feds are looking at his pecker safe. So what? How could anything hurt Donald now?<br>Secretly he loves it. He's one of us who secretly want's everyone to see his Pecker Safe. Supposedly Pecker has stuff on other hound dog 70's and 80's era Playboy swingers. We were all devotees of Hugh Hefner.It's all about who has notched the most Steve Wynns on their bed post. <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html" target="_blank">Jeffrey Epstein</a> and his pleasure island and Alex Acosta the district attorney who let Epstein off and is now Labor Secretary.<br>What is Muller going to do with Pecker's safe? What if there's even better stuff than Trump, movie stars, all sorts of celebrities and politicians.  That would piss frump off if someone else got the morethound dog prestige from Pecker's safe than him. What if Elliott Brody got more tail than frump? What if they find out about me and it turns out I actually had more nookie than any of them? Notut this is the world in which we are living. We live in a world of unlimited free porn at least I do. We live in a world of legal pot. Today the president was found to have made illegal payments to cover up affairs he was having with a porn star and a Playboy bunny. On Sunday Morning I watched a piece about a girl with huge fake boobs who is one of top hip hop rap artists. She talks about how shemade $200k as a stripper and used it to launch her singing career. I just watched an add for Liberty car insurance with a character in the witness protection program. </p><div class="editorScriptContainer"><br></div><div class="editorScriptContainer">I'm turning into a conservative complaining that the morals of the nation are worse than the good old days.
