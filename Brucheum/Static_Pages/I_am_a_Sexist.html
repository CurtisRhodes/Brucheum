            <div class='summaryText'><div class="editorScriptContainer">I have no problem working for a female boss. Females are smart and well organized and generally more rational. I will happily work for a female boss, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to think about having sex with her. Approximately every six minutes the average male is going to think about sex. It doesn't matter how she looks how's she dressed or how old and gross she is, eventually a man is going to think about having sex. And not just a generic abstract cartoon version of having sex but a nuanced detailed highly specific fantasy for each and every co worker of the opp
  
  osite sex . Just so 
  
  you know. &nbsp;</div>

<div class="editorScriptContainer">I am the father of a boy and a girl and let me report a startling little known fact; boys and girls are different. Right out of the shute boys and girls are different animals. Now let me mansplain sex for you. There is nothing equal about sex. I might as well use the F word here because by sex here I mean you know what, the act of copulation. First a taxonomy lesson. <b>Love is chemistry, sex is mechanical physics</b>. Now an instruction guide. Physical sex is something one person does to another. The sex act is a project where one party performs the operation and the other party gets the operation performed upon them. So I start with the premise the men and women are different and on the physical level <span style='display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Helvetica Neue",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'>equality </span>is not a functional term.&nbsp;</div><div class="editorScriptContainer"><br></div><div class="editorScriptContainer">Men and women are different. Women are hard for men to understand because women have cyclical lunar patterns. But no one doubts that women can be just as manipulative and calculating if not more so then men, but not in the same way. I am a male and yet I am not on the top floor in the executive suite. The men who make it to the top and make the big bucks got there because of their management of aggression. These are the men who can charm your panties off with the sincerity of their deep eyed smile but at the same time will gladly grab a competitor by the neck and rip their wind pipe out without a second thought. You don't get to the top by being a nice guy behind closed doors. Not even every man makes it to the top and so just because not every female makes it to the top is not necessarily social injustice.</div><div class="editorScriptContainer"><br></div><div class="editorScriptContainer">Now let me further mansplain what exactly I mean when I say men think about having sex with all the women in their office every few minutes. I'm only doing this because I know how much you girls love to told the facts of life by fat old bald guys. When I say men passing by you in the street think about sex I do not mean a sweet gentle romantic long loving relationship. We want to rape you. We fanaticize about having aggressive humiliating dominating unwanted sex with you, the more humiliating the better. For those of you who think that humans are a kind generous sharing species I'm sorry. We sapiens are not the descendants of peace loving village folks, we are all the direct descendants of the rambunctious hoards who raid and burn down the village and carry off the daughters and violently have their way with them. After several million years of these aggressors being favored biologically, the thin patina of civilization we currently attempt to maintain is not the natural state. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div class="editorScriptContainer"><br></div><div class="editorScriptContainer">Now let me venture into an area in which I am less of an expert. While I have already stated that men and women are different, even so, it has become my theory that despite everything society tells us, that women too like to have sex. And when I am referring to the possibility that women actually like to have sex, I am also not talking about sweet hearts and flowers lollypops and unicorns fairy tale princess sex. Women like it rough too. In the case of women I mean that women dream about having abusive sex performed upon them. When you go to the bar where are all the women in the full moon phase of their cycles hanging around? Are they conversing politely with the well dressed nerd sipping an imported beer who could provide for them a stable life? No, they are dangling off the pool table flirting with the rough tough leather clad bad boys.&nbsp;</div><div class="editorScriptContainer"><br></div><div class="editorScriptContainer">So this is the dynamic taking place in every office setting everywhere all over the world. And when girls do what they do which is doll their faces up and put on red lipstick and wear skimpy outfits showing a little cleavage, which the me too woman's movement now claims is their right, what do you think the reaction is going to be? Just wearing high heels and sheer black stocking and short skirts should be considered a violent aggressive form of sexual abuse, not the natural reaction which now considered a fireable offence.&nbsp;</div>
